All music files are designed to sound best with Alusq's Starfall music installer (or at least the drum kit from it) and with ipatix's high-quality m4a mixer patch.

Graphics assets are **not to be used without credit** and **not to be used in generative AI.** Refer to the readme, or to the installer files for a given type of asset, for authorship and credits details.
