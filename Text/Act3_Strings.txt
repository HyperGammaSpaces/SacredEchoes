Apparently, the enemy's main force has[NL]
retreated west through the forest.[AN]

But listen, Lukas...[AN]

Er, look.[AN]
You seem smart and capable and all,[NL]

Hmm...[.5] Well, I suppose there is[NL]
one thing you might try...[AN]
[Left]
And what's that?[AN]
[MidRight]
Deen and Sonya.[.5] Two of Grieth's best.[AN]
They're tough, but it's not loyalty[NL]
that keeps them in Grieth's service.[AN]
I don't know the specifics, but it's[NL]
clear they've their own ambitions.[AN]
They guard his citadel from the north[NL]
and south ends of the desert.[AN]
Break through one, and you'll have a[NL]
clear path to move on Grieth.[AN]
Whichever you fight, the other won't[NL]
go out of their way to chase you down.[AN]
...Er, probably.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hey, hold on...[AN]
