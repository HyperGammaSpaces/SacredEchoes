[MidRight]

I'm still waiting for[NL]

a good sordid story[AN]

involving knights.[NL][ToggleSmile]

So what about you?![AN]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]

...Me?[.4] My past is hardly sordid enough[NL]

to sate YOUR appetite for gossip.[AN]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]

You know, all the ladies in town keep[NL]

asking me who the knight in red is.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Which, by the way, means they're not[NL]

paying attention to me, so thanks.[AN][ToggleSmile]

But you can make it up to me with an[NL]

earful of tasty noble scuttlebutt![AN]

I don't see how that makes any sense[NL]

whatsoever, but very well. Hmm...[AN]

I courted for many a year.[AN]

Looks like the enemy is nearly[NL]
