## Ch4_4A_OpeningText
Nuibaba: Eee hee hee... Welcome, warriors of the Deliverance. My doors stand open to receive you. You're just in time for tonight's entertainment.
Alm: Nuibaba! Then the rumors are true...
Nuibaba: Rumors? Why, whatever do you mean?
Alm: They say you gather young women from all across Rigel and sacrifice them to Duma! What right do you have to make witches of them?!
Nuibaba: I'm merely unlocking their true power. And in exchange, I keep their youth and beauty for myself! Everyone wins.
Alm: They didn't choose to be sacrificed to your god! Their families didn't choose to suffer the loss of them! I won't let you sacrifice one soul more!
Nuibaba: I'm afraid you've arrived a bit late for that. Why don't I show you just what sort of force you intend to stand against?

Tatiana: Wha--? How did I get here? Ooh, it's cold--AACK! N-Nuibaba!!
Nuibaba: Silence, little lamb. You're far lovelier with your mouth shut.

Nuibaba: Eeeee hee hee hee! Much better. Now come forth, Medusa! Honor the pact you've sworn to me! Drain the life and youth from this girl directly into my veins!

Alm: Oh, no, this is NOT good. We've got to slay this fiend before that poor woman is turned into a witch!
Clive: But Alm, there's no way to the roof from the ground level. I doubt even our flying troops could safely scale it.
Alm: Rrrgh... There must be some way to clear a path! Search every last corner of this building! Anything that looks out of place, investigate it!
