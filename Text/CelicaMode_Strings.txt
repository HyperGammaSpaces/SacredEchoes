You're certain I can't dissuade you[NL]
from going, little one?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I must, Nomah.[.5] It's been years[NL]
since crops last grew on Zofian soil.[AN]
Our barren fields have fallen[NL]
victim to Terrors,[AN]
the Rigelians have invaded...[NL]
I fear some ill must have befallen[AN]
the Earth Mother, Mila.[NL]
I know this must be connected.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm...[.5] Perhaps it is, at that.[NL]
I'll not deny that the kingdom[AN]
of Zofia faces her darkest hour[NL]
in some time.[.5] More sick and hungry[AN]
come to the priory's door[NL]
each day seeking aid...[AN]
[MidLeft]
The key to everything lies with Mila.[AN]
I shall travel to her temple[NL]
and learn what's become of her.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, but little one...[NL]
You know well the reason Mycen placed[AN]
you in my care.[.5] With the king's passing,[NL]
you are the last living member[AN]
of the Zofian royal line.[NL]
There are many who would seek to use you.[AN]
Or even end you. That threat is[NL]
greater now than ever.[AN]
Yet you would still leave, knowing that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I must.[.5] Even if my decision betrays[NL]
the care you and Mycen have shown me.[AN]
You've done so much to keep me safe,[NL]
and it breaks my heart to pain you.[AN]
But this goes beyond my heart.[NL]
I can only ask your forgiveness.[AN]
[MidRight]
Keep your plea of forgiveness, child.[NL]
I'll not give what isn't required.[AN]
If this is your mind, I won't object.[NL]
Trust in it as I trust in you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Nomah.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh. Of course.[AN]
But you must take care--[.4]the blight[NL]
in Zofia is worse than you know.[AN]
You've uncommon talent as a warrior[NL]
priestess, but carelessness is fatal.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Nomah.[.5] For everything.[NL]
Well then, I think I'll be on my way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm?[.4] You're leaving this very instant?[NL]
Surely you can stay until the bell's[AN]
last peal?[.5] It rings to mourn your[NL]
father's passing, as you know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll never think of that man as[NL]
my father.[.5] Now if you'll excuse me...[AN]

If I might ask, did you happen to see[NL]
a young girl in those pirates' lair?[AN]
[Beat]No?[.4] Alas.[NL]
Then she was taken elsewhere...[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadYoungman]
It's[Beat]it's like a dream.[NL]
The pirates scuttled?[AN]
Zofia Castle free?[NL]
I keep asking people to pinch--[AN]
[Right]
The castle is freed?[NL]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Didn't you hear?[.5] The Deliverance[NL]
have run Desaix out of the castle![AN]
Word is, they have a new leader who led[NL]
the attack himself.[.5] He's a young lad--[AN]
claims to be the grandson of[NL]
General Mycen.[.5] Whoever he is,[AN]
the boy brought the entire army[NL]
back from the brink.[AN]
[Right]
General Mycen[Beat] Grandpapa?![NL]
Are you certain of this?[AN]
[MidLeft]
'Course I am![.4] Wouldn't do a man to[NL]
repeat baseless rumor, now would it?[AN]
The boy's the talk of the kingdom.[NL]
A hero's grandson turned hero himself![AN]
[Right]
Oh, gods[Beat] Then the person[NL]
leading the Deliverance is[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
It's like the dawn of a new day for us.[NL]
To think, we've got a hero on our side![AN]
The Deliverance forces are holding in[NL]
Zofia Castle for now.[AN]
But there's talk of them taking up[NL]
the march again before long.[AN]
They won't stop till there's nary a[NL]
Rigelian dog left on Zofian soil![AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Right]
Then they mean to march[NL]
on the Rigelian Army...?[AN]
[CloseEyes]Oh, Alm[Beat] How can you[NL]
be so reckless?![AN]
[FarRight][LoadMae]
[MidLeft][LoadBoey]
[FarRight]
Er, Celica?[.4] Is everything all right?[NL]
You look pale as a shade.[AN]
Did Boey tell you some stupid[NL]
ghost story again?[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
No, I'm[Beat] I'm fine, thank you.[NL]
But[Beat]might we travel to[AN]
Zofia Castle before setting[NL]
out for the temple?[AN]
There's something I need to[NL]
see for myself there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
At the castle?[AN]
You know we would[NL]
follow you anywhere,[AN]
milady, but[Beat]is that wise?[AN]
[Right]
It's been years, Boey.[AN]
No one there would recognize me[NL]
as I am now.[AN]

[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight]
Hm?[NL]
What's this, now?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Uh[Beat]n-[.4]nothing![.4] Nothing at all.[NL]
Just talking about[Beat][AN]
about[Beat]that maid![NL]
You know?[AN]
The lovely one who was asking[NL]
after you over at the pub?[AN]
Said something about wanting to give[NL]
whoever sank those pirates her 'thanks.'[AN]
[FarRight]
Did she now? [ToggleSmile]Well,[NL]
a hero mustn't spurn a lady's wishes.[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[Right]
Alm[Beat][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes] I've dreamt of you for so long.[NL]
Dreamt I might see you again.[AN]
But please[Beat]not like this.[NL]
The leader of the Deliverance?[AN]
I pray this is some horrible mistake.[NL]
Still[Beat][AN]
I'll only know for sure[NL]
once I see for myself.[AN]

Sweet jumping jesters![NL]
Now THIS is a castle![AN]
It's huge![.4] I mean, huuuuuge![NL]
And it's GORGEOUS![AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Keep it down, would you, Mae?[AN]
We're not here to gawk at the sights[NL]
like a band of slack-jawed wayfarers.[AN]
[FarRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Whatever, Professor Funslayer.[NL][OpenEyes]
Even YOU have to admit it's great.[AN]
[Right]
I never said it wasn't impressive.[AN]
A far cry from the ramshackle fishing[NL]
huts we grew up in, that's for sure.[AN]
[FarRight]
I know, right?![.4] Can you imagine[NL]
living in a place like this?[AN]
With servants and meat pies and--[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
A-HEM...[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
[FarRight]
...Oh, riiight.[AN]
Shoot, Celica, I'm really sorry.[NL]
I didn't mean to--[AN]
Actually, you know what?[NL]
I think we'll just go on ahead![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Right, you do that.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadSaber]
What's goin' on here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What do you mean?[AN]
[FarRight]
Those two's eyes near fell out[NL]
when they saw this place,[AN]
but you ain't impressed.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
What?[.4] N-[.4]no, I'm very impressed.[NL]
Speechless, actually.[.4] That's all.[AN]
[FarRight]
Uh-huh.[AN]
Well, whatever you say, lass.[NL]
Let's get inside already.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][CloseEyes]
I never thought I'd set foot[NL]
in these halls again...[AN]
But this is to see Alm[Beat][NL]
And in that case...[AN]
...Enough.[.4] I need to hurry.[AN]

Damn that one-eyed vermin![NL]
Fie and fie again![AN]
Now I must explain to Jedah[NL]
how we failed to secure the girl.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarFarRight][LoadSlayde]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]

...Beg pardon, friend.[NL]
You with the Rigelian Army, perchance?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Grr...[.4] Who asks such of me?![AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Soft, friend, soft![NL]
I'm not your enemy.[AN]
I was working under Desaix,[AN]
but those damned rebels[NL]
ran us out of the castle.[AN]
I was thinking I might[NL]
defect to Rigel...[AN]
in exchange for my services,[NL]
of course.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh. And you expect me to trust a man[NL]
who so utterly lacks shame?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You sure you can afford not to?[AN]
You just got your scrawny hides kicked[NL]
trying to kidnap one little girl.[AN]
You really want to go back to[NL]
the boss-man empty-handed?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hrm...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
See, I know about this little forest[NL]
northwest of Zofia Castle.[AN]
And in this forest,[NL]
there's a village...[AN]

How I've missed Ram Village...[NL]
Now that I'm on the mainland,[AN]

You're back![AN][MoveMidLeft]
Gosh, how long has it been?[NL]
I've missed you so much![AN]
[MidRight]
It's good to see you again, Faye![NL]
I missed you too.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The boys all left Ram.[NL]
Did you know that?[AN]
Just up and LEFT![NL]
I'm so desperately lonely...[AN]
I thought about going after them[NL]
just to teach them a lesson,[AN]
but I thought better of[NL]
just going off alone.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Hey, wait...[.4] Are you on a journey[NL]
or a quest or whatever?[AN]
Then maybe I could go with you![AN]
[MidRight]
Of course.[NL]
We'd be glad to have you.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadKliff][ToggleSmile]
Celica?[.4] [MoveMidLeft]Celica, is that you?[NL]
How long has it been?![AN]
I can't believe you[NL]
came back to the village![AN]
[MidRight]
Kliff! It's certainly been a while,[NL]
hasn't it?[AN]
Have you seen Alm recently?[NL]
How about Gray and Tobin?[ToggleSmile][AN]
[MidLeft]
Alm and the others are gone,[NL]
I'm afraid.[.4] It's...[.4] a long story.[AN]
Oh, and Sir Mycen vanished[NL]
around the same time.[AN]
Ram Village was never really exciting,[NL]
but now it's unbearably dull.[AN][ToggleSmile]
So where are you off to, hmm?[NL]
Somewhere grand, no doubt.[AN]
Say, why don't you let me come along?[NL]
I bet we could both use the company.[AN]

[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's been so very long, Celica.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Oh, Grandpapa![AN]
I'd half resigned myself to[NL]
never seeing you again.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As had I. And yet here you are,[NL]
grown into an independent young woman.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Though I fear we lack the time[NL]
for a leisurely reunion.[AN]
Surely you left the island with[NL]
some purpose in mind, yes?[AN]
[MidRight]
I did.[NL]
I'm going to the Temple of Mila.[AN]
All that's transpiring in Zofia now[NL]
is tied to the Earth Mother--[AN]
I can feel it in my very marrow.[AN]
There's more to be done than simply[NL]
fighting the foes laid before us.[AN]
I must learn Mila's will[NL]
in all of this.[AN]
I also intend to pray that she[NL]
intercedes on behalf of her people.[AN]
That she might save us all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see.[AN]
Just as Alm has chosen his path,[NL]
it would seem you have chosen yours.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm?![.4] I'd suspected as much,[NL]
but your being here confirms it...[AN]
He's leading the Deliverance,[NL]
isn't he?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why don't you go upstairs[NL]
and see for yourself?[AN]
I expect that's where you'll find[NL]
what you've been searching for.[AN]

Wait a sec...[.4] Celica?[NL][MoveLeft]
Is that really you?[.4] Celica?![AN]
[Right]
Alm[Beat] I'm so glad to see you...[AN]
I have dreamt about this day[NL]
for seven years--[AN]
At last[Beat] I've finally found you![AN]
[Left]
You have.[NL]
I've missed you too[Beat] so much.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Wow.[.4] That's quite the story.[AN]
I'm trying to picture you[NL]
swashbuckling pirates, and...[AN]
Yeah. Just[Beat] wow.[AN]
[Right]
I didn't mean to swashbuckle anyone.[NL]
It just sort of[Beat] happened.[AN]
But forget all that for the moment.[AN]
Alm, you aren't REALLY planning to[NL]
fight the Rigelian Empire, are you?[AN]
[Left]
Listen, it's not[Beat][NL]
It's not something I chose.[AN]
They were the ones who attacked us.[AN]
[Right]
But there must be a way[NL]
to resolve things[AN]
other than with bloodshed, no?[AN]
[Left]
That's a pretty thought, Celica,[NL]
but I'm not sure it's true.[AN]
If it were, no one would be risking[NL]
life and limb on the battlefield.[AN]
[Right]
Is it really so naive?[AN]
Zofians and Rigelians are both[NL]
people of Valentia, are we not?[AN]
I know we can reach some kind of[NL]
accord if we just try![AN]
Besides that, I...[AN]
I just can't imagine Emperor Rudolf is[NL]
the monster some claim him to be.[AN]
[Left]
It doesn't matter[NL]
what sort of man he is.[AN]
The Rigelian Empire chose to[NL]
cross Zofia's border--[.4]that's a fact.[AN]
We aim to drive back the invaders.[NL]
Nothing more.[AN]
[Right]
But why do YOU have to[NL]
lead this rebellion?[AN]
Mycen's grandson or no,[NL]
you're neither knight nor noble.[AN]
So why make yourself[NL]
a target like this?![AN]
[Left]
Nrgh... If I didn't know any better,[NL]
I'd swear I was speaking to a noble.[AN]
My station doesn't matter, Celica.[NL]
I'm here because I was called.[AN]
I have a duty to perform,[NL]
and I'll perform it.[AN]
No more, and no less.[AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight][MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Oh, Alm...[AN]
[Left]
Do you think I WANTED this fight?[AN]
This all started because Lima IV[NL]
went and angered the empire.[AN]
If you wish to point fingers, point[NL]
at the ruler who failed his people.[AN]
It's his fault we're in this mess.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's not...[NL][OpenEyes]
[MidRight][LoadCelica_Angry]
Well, so what if it is?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Maybe you should go become king[NL]
if it's such a damnably easy job![AN]
[Left]
What?[NL]
Celica, that's not--[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight]
You're awfully free with[NL]
accusations, for someone with[AN]
no idea what royalty entails![AN]
And now that you're a [0x93]hero,[0x94] I imagine[NL]
the throne is next on the list, is it?[AN]
[Left]
No, it's not like that at all, Celica![NL]
I just want to keep Zofia SAFE![AN]
Besides, there's an heir.[.4] A princess[NL]
of the royal family may have survived.[AN]
If she turned up and fixed all this,[NL]
I'd happily return to Ram.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You could[Beat] come with me, you know?[NL]
It'd be like old times.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]

##Ch2_Epilogue_EndNarration
Alm and Celica's heartfelt reunion[NL]
