[Silque]
Really, Acantha, I can't express my gratitude enough for getting me out of that bind in the shrine.
[Acantha]
Aw, seriously! Don't mention it. You'll embarrass me. I've got a bit of a reputation to uphold.
[Silque]
A reputation, hmm...?
[Acantha]
You know. A dashing, no-gooder rogue who steals anything that isn't nailed down! How am I supposed to be taken seriously as a criminal if I'm rescuing damsels left and right?!
[Silque]
I don't see how a reputation as a criminal is at all a desirable thing...
[Acantha]
Well, it's certainly better than no reputation at all, that's for sure. Life's boring without a juicy story now and then.
[Silque]
It's not that I don't appreciate gossip--far from it. I've heard the stories about a certain hard-drinking, gambling woman who frequents Zofia's taverns and bleeds men dry with her sleight-of-hand card tricks...
[Acantha]
Oh my. So you HAVE heard of me. Hee hee.
[Silque]
It would be impossible not to, if you've got an ear for that. However... don't you think you're better than that?
[Acantha]
...To be honest, I think they might be exaggerating JUST a little.
[Silque]
That's not exactly how I meant it. Just remember, Acantha, that the Mother is always watching.
[ClearFace]
[Acantha]
...What's that supposed to mean? Tch. Church girls... Tough crowd.

[Acantha]
So, uh, about this whole "Church of Mila" thing... mind telling me more? What's it like being a priestess?
[Silque]
Ah, of course! I'm glad you've taken an interest. After morning prayers, most of our early hours are spent in study and meditation. At noontide we take on community service projects - bringing meals to the poor and infirm, maintaining the gardens, looking after those who are ill. At night we prepare the offerings of food to Mother Mila.
[Acantha]
When's the fun stuff start?
[Silque]
Excuse me...?
[Acantha]
You know... making wine, brewing ale... the stuff a roguish scoundrel like myself might enjoy?
[Silque]
Oh-- well, on holy days we crush grapes and prepare the mash, but that all goes into the barrels to ferment for another year. It's a slow process, after all--
[Acantha]
Oh, come on! No need to be modest. You're telling me you're in a priory with a bunch of single women who worship a goddess of fertility, surrounded by barrels of fine draught, and there's not even a LITTLE drunken revelry?
[Silque]
--I'm afraid that's only a rumor...

[A]
[Silque]
Well... if you want to do the right thing, even if it's for the wrong reasons... That's still a start.
