What's wrong, Celica?[NL]
Feelin' blue?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, it's nothing.[NL]
It's just that the last time[AN]
I was on a ship was when[NL]
I came to the island.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hey, that's right![AN]
Boey and I used to take little trips[NL]
every now and again, but never with you.[AN]
Shame we never got to travel as a group.[NL]
Woulda been way more fun![AN]
[Left]
Are you completely daft, Mae?[NL]
Celica came here in hiding, remember?[AN]
She can't just announce herself by[NL]
hopping aboard a pleasure cruise.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Uh, I know that much, Boey![NL]
Of course I do![.4] I'm just saying,[AN]
I'm happy we're getting the chance NOW.[NL]
Isn't that right, Celica?[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
Please stop talking before you dig a[NL]
grave so deep we all go tumbling in...[OpenEyes][AN]
[MidRight]
Ha ha.[.4] It's fine, Boey.[.4] Really.[AN]
And I'm happy to be traveling[NL]
with you as well, Mae.[AN]
Though I'm also anxious...[NL]
What could have happened to Mila?[AN]
Will we even make it to the temple[NL]
to find out?[.4] And...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Aaaaand?[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry.[.4] Best I keep[NL]
this one to myself.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Whaaat?![.4] Oh, that's just mean![AN]

[SetName]Celica[NL]
Alm... Where are you right now?[NL]
And what are you doing?[AN]
Are you still living in that[NL]
village with grandpapa?[AN]
...No. I can tell.[AN]
You've left your home behind,[NL]
haven't you?[AN]
I want to see you so badly.[NL]
There's so much I need to ask.[AN]
Perhaps Mila will cause our[NL]
paths to cross on this journey...[A]

[MidRight]
Sorry to interrupt, lass, but looks[NL]
like we've got some company.[AN]
[MidLeft]
More pirates...?[AN]
[MidRight]
Looks like there's another[NL]
boat on our tails, too.[AN]
Maybe if we chase this one[NL]
off our path quickly enough,[AN]
we'll let the other ship know[NL]
not to cross us.[AN]

I don't plan to leave[NL]
any survivors.[AN]
But if you drop yer weapons,[NL]
I'll make sure death[AN]
comes quick![AN][ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadOldman]
Look there.[NL]
Do you see that small island out east?[AN]
That's where Barth's keep is.[NL]
He's the pirate king of these waters.[AN]
Unfortunately, this current means we'll[NL]
have to sail right past it.[AN]
It'll be trouble if we're seen, so[NL]
let's unfurl the sails and pass quickly.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hold a moment.[NL]
If we were to deal with this Barth,[AN]
would this stretch of ocean[NL]
be safer?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, yes, undoubtedly--[.4]but no one who's[NL]
sane picks a fight with a pirate king![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadSaber][MidRight]
Whoa there, lass.[NL]
I signed up for a nice,[AN]
easy escort job, not to[NL]
storm some pirate hold.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mmm... I see.[.5] ...Very well then.[NL]
I shall lead the charge myself.[AN]
You need only worry about[NL]
keeping me safe.[AN]
[MidRight]
Now just a--[AN]
[MidLeft]
The people of that island are suffering[NL]
under the tyranny of those pirates.[AN]
I can't stand by knowing starving people[NL]
are being routinely plundered.[AN]
[MidRight]
[CloseEyes]Oh, for the love of...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Look, I ain't sure why I have to remind[NL]
you of this, but you're on a mission.[AN]
And you can't finish it if you keep[NL]
pokin' your nose where it don't belong.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I have no intention of wasting time[NL]
on idle philanthropy, Saber.[AN]
But there are no guarantees I'll[NL]
ever return from this journey.[AN]
I would at least like to ensure peace[NL]
to those who have been so kind to me.[AN]
Is that so unreasonable?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hrm... Fine.[NL]
It's your neck--[AN]
go ahead and risk it on[NL]
whatever fool thing ya like.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Saber.[AN]
