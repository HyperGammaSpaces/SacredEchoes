What a relief it is to see you again, Nomah. I knew leaving Celica to your care was the right decision.
[Nomah]
Ah, it was an honor and pleasure. We've done it, haven't we? The children of prophecy have reunited, and it's in their hands now.
...Though, it wounds me that that's the first thing you say to your old friend after ten years, hm?

So it's come to this, hasn't it?
[Mycen]
It would seem so. Time has passed so quickly.
[Nomah]
Ha! It feels like only yesterday. How long has it been since last I set foot in Rigel? Forty years, surely. The cold's much harsher on these old bones now. We were so young then, weren't we?

I suppose.

Let us pass the peace-pipe and catch up on lost time.

When this peace finally comes... there'll be no call for me to swear my life to the blade anymore. I'll settle somewhere quiet and take up the plow. Perhaps Ram Village, perhaps somewhere else.
[Nomah]
Perhaps Novis Island? The priory's been in grave need of some farmers, you know.
[Mycen]
Heh. You just want the company.
[Nomah]
So transparently put! But it makes sense, don't you think? So many years have passed, enough to where we haven't anyone else in waiting. If you'd settle for staying with little old me, that is.
[Mycen]
It's hardly settling. Maybe it would do us good to clean the slate. Try again. See where it goes.
[Nomah]
Now, now, there's no slate to clean. I understood. We were looking for different things. But now the little ones are sorted off together. We've made it! Our destinies came together once more the day you asked me to look after Celica, but only now do we have the peace to enjoy it. I'd be delighted to take up with you again.

Sonya: Hey, you. You with the great eyeliner.
Leon: How sweet of you to notice, gorgeous. What can I do for you?
Sonya: Hee hee. Well, I just wanted to ask how you manage to keep it looking like this in the heat. Mine always gets smudged...
Leon: Well, of course it'll get smudged if you put so much of it on! Your eyes are sweet as cakes, but come on! That's not frosting. Ease up a little, keep it subtle, yeah?
Sonya: Mm... Subtle and I were never good friends. Either I'm looking dramatic and unforgettable or I'm not going out.
Leon: That, I can understand. In that case... you see this white rock? It's found in caves, but you can also buy it in port towns. Anyway, you grind this up nice and fine and brush it on top of your makeup and then that stuff stays ON, come hell or high water. Here, I'll break you off a piece of mine. Give it a try tomorrow morning.
Sonya: Oh, my. How generous. I'll need to return the favor somehow...
Leon: Oh, don't worry about it. I'm just glad to have somebody my age to talk makeup with. Let me tell you, those poor girls from the priory don't know the first thing about it.
Sonya: That's no surprise. I did my time in a priory as a kid. Beauty is meant to be shown off, not hidden away in some drab habit.
Leon: Exactly!

Sonya: Leon, that face powder you gave me is fantastic. It worked like a charm!
Leon: Obviously! Look at you! The difference is clear.
Sonya: I do wonder, though, how is it you came to be an expert in cosmetics? I don't usually find men among my fellow enthusiasts.
Leon: Well, thankfully my mother didn't mind me digging around in her makeup kit. My father didn't, either.
Sonya: Oh! Don't hear that one as often as I'd like.
Leon: They're great, right? Well, the boys my age weren't.
Sonya: I'd imagine not.
Leon: Perfect excuse for getting really damned good at archery, though! Each boy who gave me guff about my looks or how I talked, I'd challenge him to a test of skill. There's nothing in the world like seeing a bully's tears when he loses to the "little sissy boy". Oh, I could just sweeten my tea with them!
Sonya: Hee hee. You're petty. I like that.
Leon: Incredible motivator, really. I'm sure you've enough men's tears to fill your own teacup.
Sonya: Naturally. It infuriates me that some people can't understand power and skill coexisting with beauty. Aren't the deadliest poisons born from the brightest blooms?
Leon: I couldn't have said it better myself, darling.

Clive: My apologies, good sir. It was rude of me to stare. I just... get this strange feeling I've met you before.
Jesse: Wuh-oh, that's not good. Listen, if you've got a sister, I PROMISE I haven't done anything untoward with her. Yeah?
Clive: Heh... I fear if that were the case, she'd already have made a pincushion of you with her lance. ...What is your name, pray tell?
Jesse: The name's Jesse. I'm just your bog-standard jack-of-all-trades. Honestly, I'd be surprised if you HAD heard of me.
Clive: Mm, I'll admit, the name doesn't ring a bell. Perhaps you know of me, then? My name is Clive, knight of Zofia.
Jesse: Hold up. Clive, like, the Deliverance Clive?
Clive: Well, in truth, my fiancee founded it and I no longer lead it--but yes, that's correct.
Jesse: Ulp. How could I NOT know of you? Anyone who can READ has heard of Sir Clive. ...What could a guy like me have done to make a guy like YOU remember my face?

Jesse: Uhhh... what's this for?
Clive: He often hosted my father and I. To be quite frank, you bear a striking resemblance to him. Perhaps that's why your face seemed so familiar; I was curious if you had any familial relation to him.
Jesse: ...Well, you know how nobles are. What with the proper wives and the concubines and all that nonsense. Just because he sired me doesn't necessarily mean we had a "familial relation", you dig?

Clive: Please, I only ask you to alleviate the curiosity that's been eating at me for weeks. You have my word I'll ask no more about this.
Jesse: ...Alright, fine, let's rip the bandage off. Yes, I have seen you around before. You, your old man, and that white-haired boy that followed you everywhere.
Clive: As I thought. I always had fond memories of when your father would host us. But his son was frail and sickly, and rarely stayed to socialize with Fernand and I.
Jesse: Yeah, life was pretty rough for my brother. ...Relatively speaking.
Clive: Aha. That answers my next question, then. Lord Taranis had an incredibly witty, outspoken daughter that was his spitting image. But for the last ten years...
Jesse: Yyyyep, say no more. Man, that was so long ago. It's like hearing about my own ghost. Little creepy, to be honest.
Clive: Right... Well, I apologize if I've pried too much. I just wanted to say... I quite enjoyed the chats we used to have, Jesse. And I'm glad to know you're doing well for yourself, after all.

It was your relentless fighting that[NL]

You said I'd grown into a fine woman,[NL]

But then the war came and[NL]

But now I feel it's just[NL]

But such loss IS part of growing up,[AN]

And by the way--who ever said that[NL]
our dreams have been crushed?[AN]
It's true that things don't always[NL]
turn out the way we want them to.[AN]
But we can still find other ways[NL]
to realize our desires. Just because[AN]
you see the world for what it is[NL]
doesn't mean you have to give up.[AN]

I... suppose you're right.[NL]
I have to be stronger.[AN]
Everyone needs me to keep[NL]
my chin up, after all.[AN]

Well, so long as we're leveling with[NL]

You may not know what it is to starve[NL]

That's enough to win my respect.[AN]
I mean, it's sure as hell something[NL]

Oh, this? It's an old tactical codex.[NL]

Since I was small, all I've ever wanted[NL]

I lost out on some of the best years[NL]

You convinced me I was being a fool.[AN]
As a boy, I told myself the only books[NL]

I passed up countless valuable lessons[NL]
just to prove a point to my father.[AN]
Now I'm trying to serve as lieutenant[NL]

Every day is a painful reminder of[NL]
just how little I actually know.[AN]

Hey, Alm, I'm sorry about what[NL]
I said to you the other day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
For what you said to me when I was[NL]
holding you down so the cleric[AN]
could tend to your wounds, or[NL]
for what you said to me in our duel?[AN]
[MidRight]
Both.[NL]
The way I talked to you[AN]
and called you names[NL]
was inappropriate of me,[AN]
and I just wanted you to know that[NL]
I didn't mean anything by it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's alright, Tobin. Really.[NL]
I'm not Kliff.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
No, it's not alright.[AN]
You've been nothing but concerned[NL]
about me, and in turn,[AN]
I yelled at you and[NL]
gave you a hard time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin. Listen to me.[AN]
You made a mistake. You apologized.[NL]
Let it go and learn from it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm... I just want to impress you guys.[NL]
I want to impress my siblings.[AN]
When I come home from the war,[AN]
I don't want them to be hearing about[NL]
the exploits of Alm and his soldiers,[AN]
I want them to hear about the[NL]
exploits of Tobin![AN]
How he persevered, and... how[NL]
he did something worth talking about![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But Tobin, you've already done that![NL]
You joined the Deliverance to be able[AN]
to put food on the table for[NL]
your family back home.[AN]
Your efforts are going to put your[NL]
little brothers through school.[AN]
Even if you don't make a big name[NL]
for yourself, you'll always be[AN]
the hero that gave your[NL]
brothers an education.[AN]
And at the end of the day,[NL]
I feel like they'd care about that[AN]
a lot more than they'd care about what[NL]
me and Gray and everyone else has done.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah... Yeah! You're right![AN]
And I have you and Gray[NL]
behind me all the way![AN]
Thanks, Alm![AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't mention it.[NL]
I'm here if you ever need to talk.[AN]
[MidRight]
Back at you.[AN]

Hey Kliff. What's new?[AN]

I'll cut to the chase:[NL]
your father was a merchant, yeah?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mhmm. And a pretty damn good one, too.[AN]
[MidRight]
And he gets to travel the world?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Uh-huh.[AN]
[MidRight]
Has he ever told you stories[NL]
about his travels?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Plenty.[AN]
From the extravagant cities[NL]
in the heart of Zofia,[AN]
to the vast chasms of Macedon.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You must be jealous of him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not really.[AN]
He's always being hassled by[NL]
brigands and rogues,[AN]
and escorts cost a fortune for[NL]
journeys outside of Valentia.[AN]
I don't see how he can[NL]
stand being a merchant.[AN]
As it stands, we only just[NL]
make ends meet from his profits.[AN]
We'd be better of just harvesting[NL]
livestock and crop like everyone else.[AN]
[MidRight]
So what? You're still in the[NL]
same spot as the rest of us.[AN]
If I could travel the world[NL]
and make enough to survive,[AN]
I'd be content.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course YOU would be content.[AN]
Roaming from who-knows-where to Pyrathi[NL]

What's that supposed to mean, Gray?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, please.[AN]
Everyone knows you and your mother don't[NL]
exactly have the best relationship.[AN]
I would bet tonight's helpings that you[NL]
didn't even tell her you were leaving.[AN]
[MidRight]
And how is any of that your business?[AN]
What does my relationship with my[NL]
mother have to do with this?[AN]

Because if I had to choose between[NL]
seeing the grandiose stories of yore[AN]

Shut up and leave me alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
Would you just give me a chance?[NL]
Hear me out, buddy. Please.[AN]

Fine. I'll listen on one condition.[AN]
Never call me Kliffie-pie again.[NL]
You know how much it annoys me.[AN]

Alright, sheesh. Anyway, look...[NL]
Sorry for what I said earlier, alright?[AN]
I forgot that you and your mother's[NL]
relationship was a sore spot for you,[AN]
and it was rude of me to bring that up.[AN]
I was just angry that you didn't[NL]
consider how I felt about[AN]
my father's globe-trotting.[AN]
You always romanticize the idea of[NL]
seeing the world--meanwhile,[AN]
every night I worry I'll wake up to[NL]
a messenger telling me that my pa[AN]
met the bad end of some brute's axe.[AN]
I appreciate the stories and souvenirs,[NL]

I wish he would've been here when[NL]
I told Ma I'd joined the Deliverance.[AN]
He'd be proud of me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It's okay, Gray.[NL]
It was ill-mannered of me not to[AN]
consider that your father actually[NL]
matters in your life.[AN]
I wish I could've met my father.[NL]
Who knows how much better off Mother[AN]
would have been if he hadn't abandoned[NL]
us before I was born.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kliff... I'm sorry.[AN]
I forget that your mom wasn't[NL]
always like that.[AN]
Back when Celica was still around,[AN]
she was always doting on[NL]
her perfect genius son.[AN]
Which, by the way, meant that me and[NL]
Tobe were "those dirty village boys"[AN]
she'd gripe about to Sir Mycen...[AN]
She was quite the chatty-cathy,[NL]

Don't worry about me.[AN]
You have your own problems.[NL]
I can deal with mine alone.[AN]

Eh, there's no harm in[NL]
talking to each other.[AN]
Sometimes it helps to have[NL]
someone to talk to.[AN]

Not for me.[AN]

Well, if you ever change your mind,[NL]

Gray.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hey Kliff. How's tricks?[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you have a moment?[AN]
[MidLeft]
All the time in the world,[AN]
give or take the battle[NL]
we're in right now.[AN]
What's on your mind?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's it like outside of Valentia?[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
You said your father told you[NL]
stories of his travels.[AN]
I want you to tell me[NL]
what Archanea's like.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I'll bite.[NL]
Whaddya wanna know?[AN]
[MidRight]
What do you know about Khadein?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ooh, that's a fancy one to start with![AN]
Khadein is a beautiful city hidden[NL]
deep in the heart of an unholy desert.[AN]
It's home to the greatest[NL]
magic school on the continent,[AN]
so they're always in need of[NL]
potion ingredients and such.[AN]
Many merchants steer clear of it,[NL]
given how treacherous the journey is,[AN]
but my pa's gone down[NL]
that road many times.[AN]
[MidRight]
So your father's been there...[AN]
Has he ever crossed paths with[NL]
a man about his age,[AN]
with white hair, and one finger[NL]
missing from his left hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not that I know of. How come?[AN]
[MidRight]
Because my father was a mage.[AN]
Mother told me he vanished one day[NL]
when she began to show,[AN]
leaving nothing else but[NL]
his medal of graduation[AN]
from Khadein's academy.[AN]
He left in search of greater knowledge,[NL]
walking the path of a nomad.[AN]
No woman or child could tie him down.[AN]
And I feel like that's why my mother[NL]
is the way she is now.[AN]
She doesn't want me to leave her[NL]
like her lover did long ago.[AN]
She hates me because I remind her[NL]
so much of the man she loved.[AN]
And she's not wrong.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] That's... Wow.[NL]
That sucks.[AN]
[MidRight]
I want to travel the world.[AN]
Not just to escape from the pigsty[NL]
that I was raised in,[AN]
but in hopes that some day,[NL]
I will find my father.[AN]
I want to meet the man I take after,[NL]
and tell him how much I hate him.[AN]
Tell him how much suffering he's[NL]
put upon me and my mother both.[AN]
I might even burn him[NL]
to ash with my magic.[AN]
Someone like him doesn't deserve[NL]
my kindness or my forgiveness.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Kliff... Have you ever considered that[NL]
maybe he was doing it to protect you?[AN]
[MidRight]
To protect us?[NL]
From what?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I dunno, maybe he had a[NL]
bounty on his head?[AN]
[MidRight]
Nope.[NL]
He was a talented mage,[AN]
but he was no one special,[NL]
and I hate him for it.[AN]
And even worse, I hate that I'm[NL]
going to end up the same way.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
As in knocking a maiden up[NL]
and then abandoning her[AN]
in hopes of acquiring more[NL]
knowledge of the world?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
No. I want to leave Ram behind[NL]
once this war is over.[AN]
My mother won't let me,[NL]
and will beg me,[AN]
even try and force me,[NL]
to stay, but I won't.[AN]
I'm going to leave her because I've[NL]
had enough of manure and barn animals,[AN]
and I'm going to travel far and wide.[NL]
In that regard, I take after my father.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's just you.[NL]
She can't blame you for growing up![AN]
[MidRight]
I know. I've told her the same thing[NL]
countless times.[AN]
In the end, I always end up with a[NL]
bump on my head, and then she[AN]
has to buy a new broom the next day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then don't hate yourself[NL]
for pursuing your dream.[AN]
You can't let your ma[NL]
hold you back forever.[AN][ToggleSmile]
If you want to travel the world,[AN]
you've got one of the best friends in it[NL]

Is there a problem with that?[AN]

I suppose not.[AN]
I just prefer not to waste my time[NL]
with small talk. It's unproductive.[AN]
[MidRight] 
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, since you can't seem to get it,[NL]
allow me to spell it out for you:[AN]
I have no interest in people.[AN]
Unless I can get something[NL]
out of an interaction,[AN]

Can't you try to be pleasant towards[NL]

They're always feeding me some sob story[NL]

Or just annoying me 'cause they're jerks[NL]
and I'm apparently an easy target.[AN]
So EXCUSE ME for being a little hesitant[NL]
to talk to every stranger I meet[AN]
who claims they want to get to know me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Listen to yourself, Kliff![AN]
You are like a bitter old man[NL]
in a teenager's body.[AN]
Blocking yourself off to[NL]
kindness and goodwill without[AN]
even giving them a chance,[NL]
all for selfish reasons.[AN]
I pray that you learn[NL]
temperance and tolerance,[AN]

I don't know much about my father.[AN]

Indeed. It's a medal of graduation.[NL]

Tobin- (Alright... Breathe... I can do this... I can do this!) Hey, Clair? How goes it? 

Clair- (Focus, Clair... Despite how dashing and marvelous the boy is, he is still a commoner... You've talked to noblemen of much better quality than him and yet you must falter so now?!) Ah, salutations! 

Tobin- (She responded! I don't believe it! Come on, keep it going.) So, Clair, how's the pegasus? Not too bumpy I hope! Eheh... 

Clair- Oh it's simply marvelous, ahaha! Thank you so much for asking. (Marvelous? Thank you for asking? How utterly ridiculous!) 

Tobin- (How was the pegasus? Gah, stupid, stupid! Wait... She's still talking! Good goblets I'm doing better than I thought!) So, I was wondering, if you weren't busy later tonight... Maybe you'd want to go out for tea? We commoners don't have anything like you fancy nobles but the least I could do is treat you with something familiar. 

Clair- (Oh my, how astonishing! My luck is simply superb today!) Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed. I accept! Thank you so very much-!

Tobin- (By the mother...!) Th-then it's a date, then! Woo! Beat that, Gray! 

Clair- Hm? That's odd. I could have sworn I heard somebody speaking just now.



B



Tobin- Clair. 

Clair- Oh, hello, erm, Kliff? 

Tobin- Wha-!? You wound me milady. First you stand me up and now you're pretending like you don't even recognize me? 

Clair- I beg your pardon? 

Tobin- Just the other day I asked you to tea on the battlefield and you accepted! "Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed! I accept! Thank you so very much, Tobin!"

Clair- I- wh- Oh! Dear me! Don't you know that it's rude to pry on a lady like that?! 

Tobin- Wait, now you're accusing me of spying on you? You're heartless! 

Clair- Tobin- it is Tobin? I wasn't speaking to you.

Tobin- Then who were you talking to?! I was standing right behind you! There was nobody else around for miles! 

Clair- What I was doing is none of your business! Now please, put that event out of your mind, before I am humiliated any further! 

Tobin- I- Hang on! Clair wait! Was it something I said? 




A



Clair- *Sigh* You there, boy. I mean Tobin. 

Tobin- Hm... Oh yes hello... Clive was it? 

Clair- I suppose I deserve that. Look, what you saw the other day was merely me talking to myself. That is, practicing. 

Tobin- Why in Mila's name would you be practicing a speech? Milady, the way you speak it beautiful as is. 

Clair- Yes well, I was practicing to talk to... Someone special to me.

Tobin- You mean Alm, right? 

Clair- What? How did- yes it was Alm, but nevermind that. I feel so very awful about that whole ordeal. So as compensation, I was wondering if you'd be interested in having tea with me after this battle. 

Tobin- I thought you had feelings for Alm?

Clair- Alas, he doesn't feel the same I'm afraid. You seem nice enough Tobin.

Tobin- Then... (I've won! Suck on that Gra-) 

Clair- I was hoping you could tell me a bit about your friend Gray. 

Tobin- (Crivens...) Sure. Just name the place, milady.

Kamui: Say, you're Atlas's baby brother, huh?
Hyas: Hey! Who're you callin' a "baby?"
Kamui: Relax, kid. It wasn't a jab at you. But it's really uncanny; you look exactly like your older brother.
Hyas: I do? Well, Ma always said that we took after Pa.
Kamui: Heh, I wouldn't be surprised. You certainly fight like Atlas too.
Hyas: He trained me for a bit before leaving the village to go fight in the war. I thought I was good at what he taught me but I still wasn't strong enough to protect my little brothers... 
Kamui: Hey now, don't look so down. Trust me, those pirates play dirty. Even I was cornered by those bastards, but Celica managed to save me in the nick of time.
Hyas: It still doesn't feel good losing to them... I wish I was faster and stronger. I would've been able to take them down if I was.
Kamui: Well, I'm not sure about the faster part, but I can tell you what I know about taking a few hits.
Hyas: You'd really do that for me?!
Kamui: I don't see why I shouldn't. Unless you don't want to?
Hyas: No, no! I'll do it. When do we start?
Kamui: Easy there, Hyas. We'll start at the first watch tonight. Sound good?
Hyas: You bet! I'll see you then!
 
B
Hyas: Kamui! The training's paying off, big time.
Kamui: Heh, I'd say. You're learning faster than I can keep up.
Hyas: Er... This might sound stupid and out of the blue, but how'd you make these techniques up? 
Kamui: Well, I wasn't always a mercenary. I used to make an honest living with my family herding sheep. Herding takes a lot of energy, especially if you're on foot. The rams liked to charge at me too- 
Hyas: Huh? Herding sheep? But-
Kamui: I can already guess what you're gonna say. We got put out of business and gave up being nomads. Sold all of our sheep too. But even then, I had the itch to leave, so I took up the sword and started wandering.
Hyas: Do you ever miss it? Being with your family, I mean.
Kamui: Every now and then, I think about simpler times. Working with my siblings to take care of the flock, helping a ewe in labor, stuff like that. It's in the past now; don't mind my rambling.
Hyas: Oh... Alright.
 
A
Hyas: Shh! If you keep making noise, I'll get in trouble!
Kamui: In trouble for what?
Hyas: Agh!!! K-Kamui!
Kamui: Woah, there. Didn't mean to startle you that badly. Wait a second... Did you put on some weight? You're really slow today.
Hyas: Er... Yeah! That's it. I've been eating a lot, y'know... Ha... Ha.
Kamui: You sure have. But it wouldn't explain why you seem to be holding a critter inside your shirt.
Hyas: *sigh* Ya got me. It was supposed to be a surprise. Gig's up, Woolt.
Kamui: A... lamb?
Hyas: Well, you seemed pretty down the other day and I felt bad for you. I was gonna carve a herding staff for you, but I accidentally stumbled on Woolt while looking for a good branch. He seemed kinda lost, so I've been lookin' after him for a bit. I was gonna show you tonight during our lesson.
Kamui: A lost lamb, huh? I wager that its mother is looking for it as we speak.
Hyas: I... I didn't realize that Woolt had a ma of his own.
Kamui: Don't worry. We'll get him back to his herd before dinner tonight. If we can't find the shepherd... He can be our secret for now.
Hyas: Huh?! You're not pulling my leg, are you?
Kamui: I don't have any reason to. But we can't let the others know, alright?
Hyas: It's a deal!

Alm: C'mon, this way!
Celica: Where're we going, Alm? This part of the forest is so dark... 
Alm: Heh, don't worry! I know exactly where we're going.
Celica: Oh... Oh! This stream!
Alm: Isn't it the best? I come here all the time in the summer. And there's a little field just past here where all of us play!
Celica: It's so pretty, Alm... Look at the birds!
Alm: Animals come here to drink water all the time. I've even seen a hawk land somewhere around here.
Celica: Wow! Ooh... I wish we could stay like this forever.
Alm: Me too... Hey, do you hear that?
Celica: ... I think the others are coming!
Alm: Let's go and meet up with them! Here, hold my shirt so that you don't get lost.
Celica: Ah, o-okay! 
 
B (Flashback)
Alm: Ah... Achoo!
Celica: Oh, Alm! You look terrible.
Alm: Har, har. Thanks for the compliment.
Celica: I think you caught a cold from the other day from playing in the creek. You're running a fever! I should tell Grandp-
Alm: No, no! I don't want him scolding me again. Or worse, what if he laughs at me for catching a little cold? It "snot" funny to laugh at someone who's sick!
Celica: *snrk* Ha ha!
Alm: Hey, hey, if you drew a picture of me right now, it'd be an "ill"-ustration! Get it? Eh?
Celica: Ha ha! Oh, Alm, I think this is the most I've laughed in awhile! Hee hee!
Alm: Heh. I'm glad I could... Ah... Achoo!
Celica: Oh, I almost forgot! I'll bring Grandpapa right away, okay? Stay here, Alm!
Alm: *sigh* There goes my plan for distracting her.
 
A (Present Day)
Alm: Celica, are you alright? You looked like you were in a rough patch there.
Celica: Alm! Don't worry about me; the infantry came just in time to help me out. How do your wounds feel?
Alm: I feel alright for now, but I "sword" of feel them ache sometimes. Eh? Eh???
Celica: *sigh* I thought we agreed to advance in two groups, Alm. Shouldn't you be leading yours?
Alm: I... I ordered my troops to join up with yours.
Celica: What? Alm, there was a reason that we held the tactics meeting. That formation would've-
Alm: I don't care about formations and tactics! At least when you're in the fray. Every time we're separated on the field, I can't help but worry about you and pray to Mila that you'll make it out alive.
Celica: Alm... I never knew.
Alm: I also needed to see you while no one was paying attention. There's something that I need to confess.
Celica: N-now?! But-
Alm: I couldn't find any other time to tell you. If both of us went missing at the same time, gossip would spread faster than the wind.
Celica: What might this secret confession be?
Alm: I... Er... How can I say this without offending you?
Celica: Huh? J-just say it already!
Alm: I... I don't think I can live without you.
Celica: ?!
Alm: Something in my heart tells me that we're meant to be together. I was thinking that maybe when this war was over... that I could try to prove myself of being worthy to be at your side?
Celica: Oh, Alm. Haven't you realized?
Alm: ?
Celica: You've already proved yourself a million times over. There's no one else that I would want to spend the rest of my days with.
Alm: And I you, Celica.




C (Flashback)
Mycen: (Closed mouth sprite if possible) Rudolf, the boy is growing quite magnificently in his swordplay. He was able to strike my legs out of nowhere today! However, his natural aptitude in magic is still quite lacking--
Alm: Grandpa? Whatcha writing?
Mycen: Alm! What have I told you about sneaking up on me?!
Alm: *sigh* "Don't do it, or I may accidentally hurt you."
Mycen: That's right. A knight's training never leaves him, even after he has left the service of the king.
Alm: But, Grandpa, the stew's burning!
Mycen: Hm... Do you think you can do a very big favor for me?
Alm: *gasp* Do I get to stir it?!
Mycen: Only for today. Take care not to burn yourself with the fire.
Alm: O-okay, leave it to me! (leaves)
Mycen: *sigh* (Closed mouth sprite) Rudolf, I do not think it wise to continue our correspondence. He grows curiouser each day. Rest assured, I will care for him as best as I can, and raise him to be the hero he is destined to be. I hope you can forgive me for depriving you of news of your son. Ever in your service, Mycen.
Alm: (offscreen) Grandpa? Are there supposed to be black bits in the stew?
Mycen: Boy-- Bah. I'll be there in a second.
 
B (Flashback)
Mycen: Good work today, Alm. Your swordplay has improved faster than I expected. 
Alm: Really, Grandpa?
Mycen: Really. I've even seen you practicing by yourself or with the other children here. I'm proud to call you my grandson.
Alm: Weeeell, since I did so good, can I ask you one question?
Mycen: Since you did so "well," you "may" ask one question.
Alm: I was wondering... Could I visit my mom? Please?
Mycen: ... Alm, where is this coming from?
Alm: It was Gray's mom's birthday today. He was baking a cake for her with his sisters, and it looked like so much fun! Can't I make a cake for my mom?
Mycen: I'm sorry. Your mother and father asked me to take care of you before they went missing.
Alm: They... left me?
Mycen: They had very important business elsewhere, Alm. Please, try to understand that they loved you very much.
Alm: I... I don't need them! I've got you, Grandpa! That's... That's all I need. *sniffle*
Mycen: Oh, Alm... 
 
A (Modified B support from the game)
Alm: Grandpa.
Mycen: Ah, Alm. Are you alright?
Alm: Yeah, I'm managing... I wanted to apologize to you for earlier.
Mycen: If anything, I should be apologizing to you. Forgive this old man for all these years. I wanted to carry out your father's will for the sake of Valentia.
Alm: No, it's not that. Honestly, I thought I was deceived about my father and my birth, so I was frustrated. But that's not all. I... was sad about not being your real grandchild. I just wanted you to know this.
Mycen: Alm, I've always thought of you and Celica as my real grandchildren. I am grateful to both of you for teaching me the happiness of having a family.
Alm: Yeah. You know, you'll always be my grandpa. That's fine with you, isn't it?
Mycen: Nothing would make me happier, Alm.


Celica and Nomah

Mycen: Well, Celica, we've arrived. The archbishop here at this priory is an old friend of mine. You'll be safe and well-cared for here.
Celica: ...Grandpapa, I'm sorry.
Mycen: What for, Celica?
Celica: I've... I've messed it all up again, haven't I? If only I had joined Conrad in the fire... then everyone in Ram would be safe, wouldn't they?
Mycen: Celica, that's nonsense. You are the only hope for Zofia now.
Celica: But...
Nomah: Now, Mycen, that's a heavy burden to be placing on a child's shoulders, isn't it? Let's have no tearful goodbyes--just a warm welcome instead.
Celica: ...
Mycen: Mm, I suppose you're right, Nomah.
Nomah: Don't look so shy, little one. Is it my beard? You know, I used to not like facial hair, but then it grew on me.
Celica: ...Hee hee... Ha ha ha!
Mycen: Heh. See, Celica? You'll be in good hands. ...Well, I should be going now.
Celica: Oh... Oh, Grandpapa!
Mycen: Oof! Hah, I see that your training has paid off. You've grown strong enough to wind me with your hug.
Celica: Promise that we'll see each other again!
Mycen: Of course, dear child. One day.[ClearFace]
Nomah: So then! If I know that man--and I've known him some thirty years now--he'll keep his word. Now let's get you a proper welcome. What say you we go see what sweets are in the priory cupboards?
Celica: That sounds lovely, Archbishop.
Nomah: Ho ho! Please! Just call me Nomah.

A (present day)



Conversation 1
Conrad: Greetings, Anthiese! You're looking lovely today as usual. Hah! No need to be bashful--I merely speak the truth. Growing up at the villa, you always were my favorite sibling. Small wonder, what with my mother being Rigelian. The other siblings and their mothers always kept me at arm's length. But you and Liprica were always kind to me, and I appreciated it. ...You don't look thrilled. I'm sorry. Is it hard hearing stories of the past? I understand why you'd feel that way, but I've been in hiding ever since. For me, memories of you from the villa are some of my only happy ones.

Conversation 2
Conrad: ...Hmm? You want to hear about the night the villa was burned? My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. When I asked about you, they told me you'd died. I remember running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop till we crossed into Rigel, where I settled in the hamlet. After that, it was long days of sword practice and studying under Halcyon. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Conversation 3
Conrad: Duma Tower isn't far now. How are you feeling, Anthiese? Are you scared? Of course you'd say that. You're as strong as they come. But don't forget you have me and everyone else at your back, okay? I'm not suggesting you don't believe in us. It's more like... Sometimes it's like you're running off ahead without us, and it's...lonely. I don't know. Sorry. I'm not doing a great job of explaining this.



B Support
Celica: Conrad, I... I can't express how relieved I am to know that you survived. This whole time, I thought you were gone for good...

Conrad: I felt the same way, Anthiese. At even the first mention of "a girl with a mark on her hand", I was already saddling my horse without hearing the rest. ...Though, I did have a few false starts with that, heh.

Celica: Ahaha. Had I heard word that any of the royal family had not been taken by the flames, I can't say I wouldn't have acted on the same impulse. Though, if the Mother had decided that only one other would survive, I... I am glad it was you.

Conrad: Aww. You were always my favorite sibling too, Anthiese. Everyone else kept my mother and I at arm's length, but not you and yours. ...I was always grateful for that. I was consumed by grief when they told me you'd died. ...Now, it's curiosity that's consuming me, ever since I first set out: how did you manage to escape?

Celica: ...Oh, I... prefer not to dwell on that night if I can help it. Though perhaps, if we both get some closure, we can both move on from it. Why don't you go first?

Conrad: Oh! Of course. My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. For what felt like ages I was running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop until we were well past the Rigel border. 

Celica: ...In truth, I don't remember much detail of the night itself. It was... a lot, and I'd gotten smoke in my lungs. But a royal knight named Sir Mycen took me and fled to a small village.

Conrad: I guess we ended up with a pretty similar fate. My mother had known the Sage Halcyon when she still lived there, so I settled in his little village as well. 

Celica: The places I grew up in were small, but I had friends in both, thankfully. You've met some of mine, so I'm curious to know about yours.

Conrad: ...Oh, I, um... never outgrew my shyness, unfortunately. Most of the few happy memories I do have were of you and the villa. Not that it was a bad life with Halcyon, not at all! It was long days of sword practice and studying. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. 

Celica: Hee hee. Quite the downgrade, for a royal son.

Conrad: Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Celica: Oh! Hello, Conrad.

Masked Knight: Anthiese? Is that you, Sister?

Celica: Well, yes, of course, but... Hee hee...

Conrad: Huh? What's so funny?

Celica: S-sorry, it's just... I know in my head it's you, but you just look so INTENSE with that mask on! It's like I have two different brothers.

Conrad: Aw, whaaat? C'mon! I'm the only brother you need!

Celica: Hee hee. Yes, you're right. One is MORE than enough.

Celica: Aww... I was only teasing, Conrad. Please don't take it to heart.

Conrad: Even if you didn't mean it seriously, it's serious to me.

Celica: Oh, come on, Brother, don't be like that!

Conrad: Anthiese!

Celica: Oh! I didn't know you were so close by.

Conrad: Heh heh. Kinda funny how we keep running into each other like this, huh?

Celica: This is hardly the time for idle chit-chat, Conrad. Everyone else is fighting their hardest, and we need to do the same. Why can't you be as sharp and dashing as when you were the masked knight?

Conrad: Wait, dashing? Daaaashing? Er, one second!

Masked Knight: Any who dare lay a hand on my sister shall feel the sting of my blade!

Celica: Hee hee! Yes! THAT'S the spirit!

Kamui:
Woah, woah, woah, okay! I hear you! I get that you've got high standards, but there's no need to start picking me apart like that.

I'm sorry, but when a guy like you comes to me just looking for an ego boost, I'm going to give him what he really deserves instead.

Yeah, well, that's probably why you're still single. There's never going to be a man you think is good enough for you.

Leon:
Why do you ask? Did I knock the wind out of your sails that much the other day?
Kamui:
Just humor me.
Leon:
Hmm. That's not easily summed up in a few words, but...for starters, he should be kind, strong, and mature... while maintaining a boyish innocence. He also needs to listen, but be ready to tell the hard truths when necessary.
Kamui:
Okay, well, that's not hard. I could do that.
Leon:
And he should also be loyal, reliable, and true to his word. Never compromising who he is for anyone else's sake, but his first instinct should always be towards helping others. He should have courage and compassion in equal measure.
Kamui:
Um, okay, that's a bit of a tall order.
Leon:
Oh! And on top of all that, he should be strong as an ox and able to lift me with one arm. He's got to stand at least as tall as a draft horse's shoulder. And a handsome face with a strong jawline and a radiant smile.

Oh, come on! No one's that perfect.

Kamui:
The man did have a wife, after all. Even though you get on my nerves sometimes, I wouldn't want you wasting your time.
Leon:
In that case, I suppose I'd set off looking for another man who met my perfect ideal. A journey like that might actually be kind of... fun.
Kamui:
I think that's the first time you and I have agreed on anything.
Leon:
Oh? Were you maybe... thinking about coming with me?
Kamui:
I, uh, I wouldn't be opposed to the idea. If you were paying, I mean.
Leon:
And here I thought you couldn't stand being stuck on a boat with me.
Kamui:
Well--Maybe our little talk last time got me thinking I've got some things to work on, that's all.

Atlas: 
And what do you think you're doing right now? The fighting's over there, in case you haven't noticed.
Hyas:

I-I'm alright! I can push through for you. After all, I get to see the world because I'm by your side.

I'm just a burden on you and the whole group. I wanted to show you that I protect myself, but look how that turned out... Maybe I shouldn't have come at all.
Celica:
That's not true, Genny! I know for a fact that I wouldn't have made it this far without your healing, and I'm sure that everyone agrees with me. You're kind and willing to help no matter what. That's not a quality that you find in most people these days. I just... I don't want anyone to get hurt because of my foolishness. 
Genny:
Oh, Celica. You're not foolish at all. You're brave like a lion and wise like an owl. I wish I could be like you.

By treating you as if you were unable to fight simply because you're old... Well, that makes me no better than everyone who treats me as if I shouldn't be fighting because I'm young.

Saber: So that's how a witch like you ended up working for Grieth, eh? Must be some goal, if it's got you casting your lot in with lowlifes like him.
Sonya: I've my reasons. As I'm sure you do. It's not usually the domain of stable, well-adjusted folk to take on the lonely life of a mercenary.
Saber: You got that right. ...Heh. Looks like we'd make a pretty good team, you and I.

Fernand![.4] There you are.[AN]
When I didn't see you on[NL]
the ballroom floor,[AN]
I was concerned you'd left already.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh, no.[AN]
My father would have my head[NL]
if I dared do something like that.[AN]
I just don't have[NL]
much taste for dancing.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha. That, I can understand.[AN]
I'm not sure if it's[NL]
only the wine talking,[AN]
but I was starting to[NL]
tire of it, myself.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's surprising.[AN]
Every noble lady in attendance[NL]
was falling all over herself[AN]
trying to be your dance partner.[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't mind the attention, per se,[NL]
but I do worry when my dearest friend[AN]
isn't having a good time.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You're a dashing fellow yourself--[AN]
we could have made an[NL]
unstoppable team out there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What, me picking up your leftovers?[AN]
Heh. No, I'd rather not.[NL]
I'd only make a fool of myself.[AN]
[MidRight]
You were perfectly good at it[NL]
when we practiced together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-Yes, well, that's different.[NL]
For one thing, we were alone.[AN]
And for another, it's different when[NL]
it's someone I've known my whole life.[AN]
[MidRight]
It'd be a shame for you to leave[NL]
a dance party without having been[AN]
on the floor at least once.[NL]
Why don't you be my partner this time?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
O-Oh--[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heavens, no![AN]
I mean-- I'm flattered, truly,[NL]
but imagine the stares we'd get.[AN]
There'd be gossip about us for months.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Ha ha! I'm sorry. You are just[NL]

//they talk about mathilda idk

Clive:
Fernand, let me hear your thoughts on something. It's about the battalion. How do you judge their skill?
Fernand:
Certainly. I'd say I'm not disappointed. I see no shirking of duty, and no one's missed practice by my count.
Clive:
Would you say anyone in particular stands out in their performance?
Fernand:
Well, it should be obvious no one could ever match yours, if that's what you're asking. Though I suppose the lady one's doing fairly well for herself.
Clive:
That Mathilda is a force to be reckoned with. She's easily more skilled than myself, even. Yet even with such strength, she's still as lovely as a rose.
Fernand:
If you say so.
Clive:
Hah! I'd expect more enthusiasm from you. The other knights are all agog at her beauty.
Fernand:
She's, er... not exactly to my tastes. I prefer a bit more... meat on the bones, so to speak. Besides, a woman her age would be better served looking for a husband rather than a target for her weapon.
Clive:
Fernand! That's a line too far. As I recall, your father's incessantly been asking after your own marital prospects of late. Don't you think she'd be just as tired as you are of hearing such?
Fernand: 
Urgh. Yes, you're right. He's gone as far as to threaten to choose a bride for me if I don't start searching for my own in earnest.
Clive:
Don't sound so down, Fernand. If you'd just be a bit more outgoing, I know you'd have no trouble finding a suitable woman to court.
Fernand:
...Clive, that's the PROBLEM. I can't exactly call it "having trouble finding" when I've no interest in searching in the first place. It's no easy task to feign interest when there's someone in your heart already.
Clive:
Oh?! Which lucky maiden has fetched Fernand's heart? Why don't you introduce her to me?
Fernand:
I-- I don't have time to stand around gossiping like hens. I must go tend to the new recruits. Farewell.[ClearFace]
Clive:
Oh, now my interest is well and truly piqued. Hmm... "meat on the bones", he said? Perhaps he likes them plump...

//idea is, clive has to turn fernand down during one of the worst traumas he's ever dealt with
//while fernand laments that he's the end of his own noble lineage, just a broken branch on the family tree

Clive:
How do you fare today, Fernand...?
Fernand:
...Surviving, I suppose.
Clive:
Well, it's certainly better than the alternative, at least. I hope I can give you no cause to doubt that I will be by your side through all of this. You have my word.
Fernand:
I appreciate it... truly. Your mere presence... alleviates the burden on my heart.
Clive:
You will always be like family to both Clair and myself. I know it's not enough to fill the void, but... we are here for you.
Fernand:
...Please, Clive. Would you stay for just a little longer?
Clive:
Of course.
Fernand:
...Do you remember that night at the ball five years ago when we danced together?
Clive:
How could I not remember? You were the happiest I'd ever seen you.
Fernand:
It's no coincidence that my father suddenly remarried shortly after. My half-sister... She was only four years old... She was his hope.
Clive:
Of course--but you, a proud and accomplished knight, were his hope as well. What are you saying, Fernand?
Fernand:
...With their passing, our proud and ancient bloodline will die with me. There are no other heirs to it left alive, and I am... nothing more than a broken branch on our family tree.
Clive:
Don't say that, Fernand. Hope is not lost for you yet. You are a strong, handsome, refined knight, more than you even know. The ladies will flock to you in due time. Someday, you'll--
Fernand:
No, Clive. I will not. I was not made like you. I was not made to love a woman. ...My father realized it, that very night. The abject disappointment that veiled his gaze is burnt forever into my mind.
Clive:
...Oh, Fernand, I--I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you into--
Mathilda (offscreen):
Clive! Oh, where has he gone now? Clive?
Fernand:
...Your lady is calling for you. You should go to her.
Clive:
But, Fernand--
Fernand:
Just... go. Before I change my mind. Now go!

Greetings, Fernand![NL]
It's been far too long.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Clair. You know, it still[NL]
confounds me that you decided[AN]
to enlist with the knights.[AN]
Your father is too lenient[NL]
with you. Always has been.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
And why shouldn't I be a knight?![AN]
I wield a lance and ride a horse[NL]
as well as the best of you.[AN]
Perhaps even better. Why else[NL]
would they allow me to join?[AN][MoveMidRight]
Heavens, you and my brother[NL]
were the ones who TAUGHT me[AN]
to fight and ride.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Because you harangued us without end.[AN]
You always were keen on following[NL]
Clive. Honestly, we assumed it was[AN]
a phase you would grow out of.[AN]
You should be looking for a husband,[NL]
not brandishing a weapon.[AN]
...Unless you expect to meet your[NL]
soulmate on the battlefield?[AN]
[MidRight]
I have no fondness for barbaric men.[AN]
But pursuing a warrior's path does not[NL]
doom me to a life of spinsterhood.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Now that I'm a Knight of Zofia,[NL]
I can stay here at the castle,[AN]
where I can go to royal balls[NL]
and meet fine gentlemen.[AN]
What say you to THAT?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I say that you should have listened[NL]
to your vows more carefully.[AN]
Knighthood affords little time to[NL]
twirl about in circles and socialize.[AN]
Day and night, we train and ride[NL]
out on expeditions and other missions.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
What?! Goodness, I don't remember[NL]

Perhaps I will have to seek my beloved[NL]

Still, it's not all bad--the Knights[NL]

why don't YOU introduce me to someone?[AN]
Surely you must know many[NL]
suitable suitors in suits of armor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Um[Beat] Well, I suppose it depends[NL]
on what manner of man you fancy.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Hmm... Let me think...[AN]
He'd have to come from a house[NL]
at least as respectable as my own...[AN]
He should be as tall as Clive,[AN]
and fair of face... Well-lettered,[NL]
and gifted in the arts of war...[AN]
And of course he must be well-versed[NL]
in poetry and music and... Hmmm...[AN][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]
Oh! He should own four villas,[NL]
one for each of the seasons![AN]
[Beat]Does that narrow it down?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][HalfCloseEyes]It certainly does.[NL][OpenEyes]
You just described your brother.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
That is not true![AN]
[MidLeft]
And you don't even realize it...[NL]
Clearly you are still a child.[AN]
You won't find a husband if you keep[NL]
clinging to your brother in such a way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, really? And what about you?[AN]
You've been clinging to my brother[NL]
since before I was born, Fernand.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Is there anything YOU should be[NL]

you aren't exactly scrambling to[NL]

Besides, Clive already told me[NL]
what your true weakness is.[AN]

Now which of the knights' eligible[NL]

[MidLeft]
Oh, if you only knew.[AN]
I adore talking with him, but[Beat][NL]
Well, he doesn't know how to loosen up.[AN]
He's very self-conscious.[AN]
I want to hear about his misadventures,[NL]
not just what he thinks I want to hear.[AN]
[MidRight]
So he never told you about sneaking[NL]
into the mess hall before lunch?[AN]
Or the story of licking the[NL]

Surely he's told you about trying[NL]

they fled the pen and[NL]

He may look all gallant and composed,[NL]

Clive can be quite the ruffian when[NL]

He makes me look like a saint.[NL]
I suggest you be careful.[AN]
