##SilqueFaye_C
Silque: Hello, Faye.
Faye: Oh, Silque! We seem to keep running into each other here on the battlefield.
Silque: Yes, well, I was hoping we could get to know each other better. There are so few of us women fighting alongside Sir Alm, after all. And there are many things I wish to talk about that aren't for the ears of men.
Faye: Oh, um... Like what?
Silque: ...Well, you know. Things you wouldn't talk about with your male friends.
Faye: ...I don't know of anything like that. My only friends are the village boys. So, I don't know what I'd talk about with you that I wouldn't talk about with them. Especially because I kind of just met you.
Silque: We could always start with a bit of gossip... That Gray's a bit of a scoundrel, isn't he?
Faye: ...Um, no offense, but I don't think that kind of gossip is for me. Anyway... good luck, I guess!
Silque: What in Mila's name just happened? Perhaps I'll need to rethink my approach...
[X]
##SilqueFaye_B
Silque: Faye! There you are!
Faye: Hello again, Silque. You sure are persistent.
Silque: I would like to make a proposal. If you don't like gossip, why don't we talk about where you grew up? I love traveling, and I'd love to know more about Ram Village.
Faye: Oh, um, well... It's peaceful and quiet. It's very small. There were only a few kids my age, so we all became friends. Most everyone else were farmers. My parents raised sheep and flax plants. Um... I don't know what else to say, really.
Silque: Oh, so they worked with textiles? Do you like to sew?
Faye: I do, a little...
Silque: Like embroidery? Or like tailoring?
Faye: Um... Both, kind of.
Silque: Those flowers on your apron are cute. Did you make those?
Faye: --Look, Silque, I'm... not good at talking about stuff. It's okay. Not everyone has to be friends, right? Maybe we should just focus on the battle. Bye.
Silque: Faye? ...Faye? *sigh* I've lost her again...
[X]
##SilqueFaye_A
Faye: Hello, Silque.
Silque: Faye? I thought you'd never speak to me again.
Faye: Weeell... After you stopped approaching me, I realized I kinda... miss your company. Sorry I was so rude.
Silque: Oh, it's all right. It's just nice to feel missed. And now we can finally talk!
Faye: Right... about that. I actually did have a girl who was my friend, once. But she left, and she never came back. Maybe it would be nice to have a friend like that again, but... You're not going to leave one day without saying goodbye, right?
Silque: Of course not! I promise, Faye, I'm not going to do anything like that.
Faye: Hee hee. You're a good person, Silque. Even if your tongue does like to wag. Maybe... we can be friends. I would like to know more about you. And it's easier if you do the talking.
Silque: Ah, how lovely. Maybe I can tell you about the places I've seen on my travels?
Faye: I'd like that.

[MidRight]
Excuse me, sir--
Luthier, was it?
[MidLeft]
... ...
[MidRight]
I just wanted to check
if you were well. Magic
takes a toll on the body,
and I'm worried you're
pushing yourself too much.
[MidLeft]
Magic--Oh. You were talking
to... me?
[MidRight]
Er--yes, I was.
...Would you rather I didn't?
[MidLeft]
That wasn't what I meant.
I intended to communicate that,
er... that doesn't happen
very often. I was merely
caught off guard.
[MidRight]
I see...
Luthier, I've noticed you don't
ask for help even when you've
exhausted your magic reserves.
So I wanted to be proactive and
see how you're doing.
[MidLeft]
That's not necessary.
I know my limits.
[MidRight]
Well, I'm sure you do, but I would
prefer that no one in our group
neglects their health. So please
let me know if you're feeling weary.
[MidLeft]
If you insist.
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
...Well, he's certainly... curt.
[X]

## SilqueLuthier_B
[MidLeft][LoadSilque]
[MidRight][LoadLuthier]
[MidRight]
I require your assistance.
[MidLeft]
Oh--hello, Luthier.
How are you feeling?
Should I heal you up?
[MidRight]
No, there's no need for that.
Well--maybe as a demonstration.
You see--you've mastered a type
of magic I do not yet have command of.
Teach me your ways. I must study it.
[MidLeft]
...Um, well, I'm not sure how much
I can teach... White magic comes from
faith and piety. I could help lead you
in prayer sometime, but faith itself
isn't something I can teach.
[MidRight]
Obviously. Magical ability comes from
the blood. But magical applications
come from intense study. There must be
some holy text or ritual you perform
to maintain your communion with the
spirits. In this case, I should say,
with Mila herself. I presume she is
the source of healing magic, as
described in the Zofian Grimoire,
page 47, paragraph 2. "The Mother
giveth to the land the power of life,
and to the plants which grow in--"
[MidLeft]
--Er, yes, I've read that. It's
just as you said, prayer to Mila
reinforces your bond of faith, and--
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah, so you've read it too! I've
been searching for someone to discuss
its merits with. So few seem to have
truly studied the text. I'm currently
on my one hundred and fifth re-read.
[MidLeft]
That's very dedicated of y--
[MidRight]
--What did you think of the author's
description of the transfer of
life-force between caster and spirit?
I visualize it each time I cast.
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Er, well, truthfully, I've only
skimmed it. I know little of magic
beyond the church's teachings.
I preferred to learn through
practical applications - healing
the sick, meeting others on
pilgrimages...
[MidRight]
You really must finish reading it.
I insist--it's life-changing.
It's my gift to you in knowledge
so that perhaps you will share
your knowledge with me.
I hope this can be the start of
a regular discusson on magical
study techniques.
[MidLeft]
...All right, Luthier.
Let's make a deal.
I'll read the whole book
if you can promise me you'll
put your health first.
Come visit me at the first
sign of weariness.
--And don't stay up
all night reading.
[MidRight]
Mm... I'm afraid that will be
tough to commit to.
But if that's what is needed to
advance my knowledge of white magic,
then you have my word.

## SilqueLuthier_A
[MidLeft][LoadLuthier]
[MidRight][LoadSilque]
[MidLeft]
I thought seriously about what you
said, and I've found it to be
empirically true that studying with
others leads to a greater rate of
information absorption. You mentioned
going out and meeting others on
pilgrimages. ...Perhaps that's
what I've been missing.
[MidRight]
...You seem to keep to yourself
quite a lot. I think it would do
your soul some good to travel
and speak with others more often.
[MidLeft]
I find that prospect frankly...
terrifying. People don't often like
to talk with me, you see. In fact,
I... really don't have any friends.
[MidRight]
...You don't?
[MidLeft]
Well--I do, but... I suppose cats
don't count...
[MidRight]
Oh, you love cats too? We used to
keep some in the priory's granary
to help with the mice. I'd always
visit them after evening prayers.
It seems they only liked me when
I brought them fish, though.
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah, that's a common misconception.
You may think them aloof creatures,
but when they turn and sit quietly,
not facing you, it's actually a sign
of affection, as the cat feels
comfortable enough to not have to
keep watch over y--
[MidRight]
--You know, Luthier, when you talk
about something you love,
your whole face lights up.
[MidLeft]
...Oh.
If I'm boring you,
please say so.
[MidRight]
Oh, no, that's not a bad thing.
It's a sign of dedication and passion.
[MidLeft]
... ...
That's... the nicest thing anyone has
ever said to me.
[MidRight]
All I ask is that you take better
care of yourself so you can pursue
those passions. Put the candle out
before the rooster crows. Get out
and talk more with others who love
the same things you do.
I'm sure you'll find more friendly
ears than you thought you would.
[MidLeft]
...All right, I've decided.
I will venture forth and find a
commune of mages with whom I can
discuss my studies.
...Since you're the one who
inspired this idea, I'd like to
extend the invitation to you as well.
[MidRight]
...Well, after the war ends...
It was my hope to give aid to the
people of Zofia as they rebuild and
recover. But someday... I would like
to travel again. Don't delay your
dreams because of me, but when you
return to Valentia, perhaps I'll
depart with you then.

## LukasClive_C
Lukas: Clive.
Clive: Ho, Lukas! Well met.
Lukas: So how does it feel to have doffed the oh-so-heavy mantle of leadership?
Clive: Ha ha! Do I sense a hint of judgment there? I wager I'm lucky someone as level- headed as you keeps me on my toes. Forsyth is all drive and emotion, while Python... Well, Python hardly seems to care about much of anything. Both are fine soldiers in their own ways, but neither is a great advisor.
Lukas: Ha ha ha. Well, don't tell Forsyth. He'd crawl into his bed and never come out again.
Clive: *sigh* I'd laugh were it not true. You see why I need someone like you? A cold observer to watch over me.
Lukas: ......
[X]

## LukasClive_B
Lukas: ......
Clive: Is something wrong, Lukas? Why the troubled expression?
Lukas: Clive... I was thinking over what you said. About my being a "cold observer"?
Clive: What, that?
Lukas: Yes, that. It's true--I AM cold. Few passions ever manage to flare up in me. Granted, I'm not nearly as dispassionate as Python... But just once, I should like to be red with rage, green with envy... Something! I wonder if it is normal to feel so... detached.
Clive: Of course it is. And I believe such perfect composure to be a virtue beyond compare.
Lukas: Well, I am who I am. I imagine I should stop hoping for more.
[X]

## LukasClive_A
Clive: Lukas.
Lukas: Clive, what is it?
Clive: The war is drawing to a close. I just wanted to offer thanks for your many services to the Deliverance. Without your fiery presence, we never would have made it this far.
Lukas: My...fiery presence? Are you certain you aren't confusing me with someone? Or is this an attempt to cheer me up after our last heart-to-heart?
Clive: Er...n-no! Of course not! *sigh* And here I thought I was being subtle. People always see right through me in a way they never do you.
Lukas: Well, that's because I'm the cold and composed one. Heh heh. Why do you keep me around if not for my greatest virtue?
[X]

## ClairMathilda_C
Clair: Oh! Lady Mathilda.
Mathilda: Ah, Clair. It's been a while since we've spoken like this.
Clair: It really has. I was dreadfully worried about you after Desaix took you captive. Thanks be to the mother that you're safe and sound.
Mathilda: No, thank YOU, Clair. It was your relentless fighting that put Desaix's machinations to an end.
Clair: I know what it's like to be held prisoner. I remember how small my cell was in the Southern Outpost. I could hardly sleep at night for fear of what might happen to me. But when I imagine what you went through... And how long you endured...
Mathilda: You have a good heart, Clair. It means everything to me to know you cared so deeply. But I was never afraid. I knew in my heart that Clive would come for me.
Clair: You truly are strong, Mathilda. I hope that I might learn from your courage.
Mathilda: And I from your kindness.
[X]

## ClairMathilda_B
Mathilda: ......
Clair: Lady Mathilda, is something amiss? You've been looking at me so...intently. I would ask that you speak your mind.
Mathilda: Ah. Forgive me. Id din't mean to stare. I just cannot help but notice how much you've changed.
Clair: Me? In what way?
Mathilda: Do you recall the last time we spoke like this? You were so compassionate. Recently, I've taken note of how you look out for everyone around you. You're there for them before they even think to ask for help. You've grown into a fine woman.
Clair: Really? I hadn't noticed. Also, I think you may be imagining it.
Mathilda: Aha, but you just proved it.
Clair: I... did?
Mathilda: The old Clair would have snapped at the suggestion she'd done any growing up. You always did hate being treated as a child, even when it was the case.
Clair: What? That simply isn't true! ...Well, maybe it's a LITTLE true.
Mathilda: Ha ha ha.
[X]

## ClairMathilda_A
Clair: Lady Mathilda.
Mathilda: Hello, Clair. Do you need something? It's not often you come to me looking for conversation.
Clair: Something you told me before has been foremost in my mind of late.
Mathilda: And what is that?
Clair: You said I'd grown into a fine woman, but then I started thinking about it... It's not so much that I grew up as that I had to leave part of myself behind. I miss the old days when Clive and Fernand and I lived in the castle. Being a knight of Zofia was hard work, but I was basically carefree. If ever I became cheeky with you, it's because I was...happy. But then the war came and crushed all of our dreams. I grew up thinking that the world revolved around me. But now I feel it's just spinning madly about for absolutely no reason at all.
Mathilda: Clair...
Clair: I know, I know. You're going to tell me this is what it means to grow up. But I MISS the part of me that believed things would always turn out all right.
Mathilda: You may mourn it all you like, Clair. But such loss IS part of growing up, and it's turned you into a fine woman.
Clair: ...Thank you, Mathilda.
Mathilda: And by the way--who ever said that our dreams have been crushed? It's true that things don't always turn out the way we want them to. But we can still find other ways to realize our desires. Just because you see the world for what it is doesn't mean you have to give up.
Clair: I...supposed you're right. I have to be stronger. Clive needs me to keep my chin up, after all.
Mathilda: You will be happy again one day, Clair. I promise you this. And Clive and I intend to be part of that happiness.
Clair: I hope so.
Mathilda: I KNOW so. And feel free to lean on me more, okay? After all, we'll be sisters someday.
Clair: Heh, if you keep being this nice, I SUPPOSE I'll allow it.
Mathilda: Ha ha ha! Thank Goodness for that!

## PythonClive_C
Python: Uuuuugh! Is the battle over yet? This is exhausting. Just get me as far away from the front lines as possible!
Clive: Python.
Python: Ahh! Yes?! Um... yes?
Clive: Why the surprise? I just wanted to see how you were faring.
Python: Oh. Well, I suppose I've had better days. ...Uh, sir.
Clive: Honesty always was your finest trait. Still, now that Alm has assumed leadership, we've many new recruits. They're inexperienced, and even frightened in many cases. Such men look to you, and it would behoove you to set a better example.
Python: Beggin' your pardon, but I ain't so sure that's a good idea. Folks already got you and Forsyth and Lukas for role models if they want 'em. If ol' Python starts acting all hoity-toity, they'll have no one approachable left. Someone around here has to stay on their level.
Clive: I understand, but this is an army. We must also teach them discipline.
Python: You won't get discipline if you don't create a welcoming atmosphere.
Clive: And you don't think we have that now?
Python: Well, I didn't say THAT. ...Er, sir. But truth is, it's not always easy for everyone to find his or her place here.
Clive: I see...
[X]

## PythonClive_B
Clive: Ah, Python. I'm glad I found you.
Python: Something wrong?
Clive: I must confess, our last discussion has been weighing on me quite heavily. I seek to close the rift between the Deliverance's nobles and commomers. But there are days when it seems to only grow wider. Have I not endeavored to treat those of low birth fairly? I always thought to reward my men based on merit, not station. And yet you believe that some still struggle to fit in.
Python: Well, you won't win any points by using terms like "low birth." ..Sir. You make it sound like it's our privilege to be elevated to your level. Like if we don't have your station, then all we really have are our merits.
Clive: I never meant to slight you, Python. Nor anyone else.
Python: Yeah, I know that. And anyway, you didn't create the order of the world. It ain't your fault. But respectfully and all? You might wanna stop preaching understanding. You can't understand us. Not really. Your life is just very...different.
Clive: You're right. I've never had to worry about starving or freezing to death. I have never had to face the same indignities or despair as you. Yet in trying to champion those causes, perhaps I have become a hypocrite.
Python: Eh, don't flog yourself about it. Lots of commoners want a champion like you. Hell, Forsyth practically walks behind you tossin' out rose petals. But some of us commonfolk just aren't ever going to relate to you, so... You know what? What do I know. Forget I said anything, sir.
Clive: Python, wait.
[X]

## PythonClive_A
Clive: Python.
Python: Sir Clive. Your spirits lifted yet? Sorry for running my mouth, by the way. After our last heart-to-heart, everyone blamed me for putting you out of sorts. Clair practically had me at lancepoint. ...Wait, not practically. Literally. Anyway, if you could tell 'em to let up on poor Python, I'd appreciate it.
Clive: I apologize for what you went through. ...Especially that lance business. It took me some time to come to grips with all you told me. Would you here me out?
Python: All right...
Clive: Python, I believe in structure. There should be a king and a nobility, and beneath them, common people. That is the structure I was born into. And, to be blunt, I still believe it is the structure a kingdom needs to survive. So, I apologize if that does not sit well with you.
Python: ......
Clive: But I CAN believe all that and still have tremendous respect for you. I mean what I say, Python: Noble or common, any man who fights at my side is my ally and friend. I just wanted you to know that.
Python: ...I really got your silk stockings in a bunch, didn't I? Well, so long as we're leveling with each other, I think you're dead wrong. Nobles living fancy while the people starve ain't structure-it's privilege. And I hate any man who looks down on me because of it. Now, does that mean I hate you? No. You may not be my FAVORITE person in all the land, but-
Clive: Clearly not.
Python: Heh. Touché. Well, let's just agree to disagree on this point, eh? You may not know what it is to starve or freeze, but you still put your life and livelihood at risk for the sake of others. That's enough to win my respect. I mean, it's sure as hell something you'll never catch ME doing!
Clive: Heh.
Python: So even if you don't have my undying affection, rest assured you have my bow, at least until this mess is over.
Clive: This gladens me, Python. Thank You. I cannot say what waits for us at the end of all this, but I hope that we will secure better lives for noble and commoner alike. So please keep fighting-if not for me, then for Alm.
Python: Ugh. I said I would already, didn't I? Ah, whatever. You got it, sir!

## PythonLukas_C
Python: *yaaaaawn*
Lukas: Python, I think an entire village could be swallowed up in one of your yawns. Perhaps you should try sleeping instead of staggering back to camp at sunup. I cannot turn a blind eye to this type of behavior forever. You're a soldier. Occasionally, we need you to behave like one.
Python: Sir, yes, sir! Crivens, what is it with you knightly types? Don't you know how to get out and let your greaves down a little?
Lukas: We haven't always been so formal. But now Zofia is at war, and we must-
Python: Wait. Stop. You actually USED to be more footloose and fancy-free? So you're saying if I dig deep enough, I might find dirt on Clive?!
Lukas: I...wouldn't go that far. But I have heard tale that all the ladies of court would giggle as he passed by.
Python: Pfft. BOOO-RING. I mean, at least tell me they were SALACIOUS giggles. Come on, Lukas. Fill old Python in here. Is our Clive a dirty boy? Eh? Eeeeeh? I promise I'll only tell my closest friends.
Lukas: *sigh* Your decorum continues to amaze.
[X]

## PythonLukas_B
Python: Oy! Lukas!
Lukas: What is it, Python?
Python: I'm still waiting for a good sordid story involving knights. So what about you?!
Lukas: ...Me? My past is hardly sordid enough to sate YOUR appetite for gossip.
Python: Are you suuure? You know, all the ladies in town keep asking me who the knight in red is. Which, by the way, means they're not paying attention to me, so thanks. But you can make it up to me with an earful of tasty noble scuttlebutt!
Lukas: I don't see how that makes any sense whatsoever, but very well. Hmm... Well, back home, there was a woman I courted for many a year.
Python: Ooh! Now we're getting somewhere. Was she a looker? Was it serious? Were her eyes like shimmering--
Lukas: Stop pestering me like an old maid. Looks like the enemy is nearly upon us. Let's get back to it.
[ClearFace]
Python: Hey, wait! Come back! I wanna hear about your special lady friend!
[X]

## PythonLukas_A
Python: Heh heh... I've got you cornered now, Lukas. Now I'll hear every last juicy detail about that woman you courted!
Lukas: Juicy...? *sigh* I fear you are going to leave this conversation sorely disappointed.
Python: Hmm. I'll admit, the mention of her doesn't quite seem to fire your loins. So what's the story? Don't you love her?
Lukas: Fire my...? Honestly, Python? I'm not certain if I love her or not. Since being parted from her, I feel no particular longing to see her again. I sometimes wonder if a vital part of me is broken. I look at Clive and Mathilda and see... Well, you used the word "fire." But whatever it is that they have, I seem to lack it.
Python: Aw, don't you worry. You're still young. The "one true love" thing isn't for everyone. Certainly not for me. And I dare anyone to tell ME that I'M broken.
Lukas: So you think such lack of feelings are normal?
Python: Perfectly! If you ask me, Clive and Mathilda are the weird ones. The ways they look at each other with rainbows shootin' from their eyes... Heh. Look, one day you might decide you miss your lady. But take it at your own pace.
Lukas: My own pace... That's... surprisingly sound advice.
Python: And if she falls into the arms if another man before you come around, so be it. I'll be here to cheer you up. We can hit the town, quaff some ale, spend all your money... It'll be great!
Lukas: Heh heh. I don't doubt I would be in good hands...

Forsyth: Python! Ho, Python!
Python: Crivens, here he comes again. What is it now, Forsyth?
Forsyth: [bounce] Don't give me that innocent mummery act! Do you think I'm not watching you? Sir Alm and the others are fighting five times as hard as you are! You're barely even pretending to try! Have you no honor or shame?!
Python: Shame? Me? Nah, sorry, not feelin' it. But good on them, I guess?
Forsyth: Why can you not take ANYTHING seriously?!
Python: Uhh... 'cause I'm more effective when I don't?
Forsyth: Oh, you needn't tell me twice. I'm well aware of how you function in this world. No goals. No passion. Just flitting about while doing the bare minimum. Your life must be so horribly empty.
Python: It's pretty grand, actually. Y'know, maybe if you had any experience with partying all night and picking up girls at the tavern, you'd stop painting me as the picture of misery and woe. 
Forsyth: I-Is that why you're always sneaking back into the tent at damn near daybreak?!

Forsyth: [bounce] I am not an "it", you daft fool! What is your PROBLEM? You can be rude to me all you like, but as your lieutenant, laziness on the battlefield is unacceptable!
Python: Cripes, man, lay off. I slept funny last night. As one does when there's a barmaid's arm under your neck.
Forsyth: I-- Wh-- D'aah-- Spare me the details!! The excuses you come up with for not trying are beyond comprehension!
Python: That's 'cause you're not TRYING to comprehend them. Look, I'm not like you. I'm not here to chase a stupid dream. I'm here to get paid and not starve, and dreams don't fill the belly. Or pay for life's other comforts.
Forsyth: Python, that's-- That's utterly depressing! Dreams are what make life worth living!
Python: You do enough dreaming for the both of us, pal. I can't go two days without hearin' about how "Sir Clive is gonna knight me for sure this time!" Give it a rest already!
Forsyth: Maybe if you actually TRIED for once, he'd knight you too!
Python: Ugh, there you go again. I swear, you talk about the man like he craps gumdrops and sugar sprinkles. Hell, I bet you'd lick 'em up with a smile and ask for seconds.
Forsyth: Th-- That is ENOUGH out of you! If we weren't on the battlefield, I would slap those words out of your mouth! I'm going on ahead! Don't even think about following me!
Python: Eeesh... Touch-eey.

## ForsythPython_A
Forsyth: ... ...
Python: Forsyth? You all right there, pal? You haven't yelled at me yet. In fact, you NEVER snap at me anymore. Don't tell me you've given up.
Forsyth: ...I wouldn't call it "giving up". 
Python: ...Aw, come on, Forsyth, don't give me the kicked puppy eyes...! You know I can't handle the kicked puppy eyes.
Forsyth: Python--You've really never had a dream you've truly believed in?
Python: I never said THAT. I just wouldn't stake my life on one.
Forsyth: I would. But do you know what I wouldn't stake?
Python: Let me guess. Sir Clive?
Forsyth: No, Python! My best friend! You. 
Python: Aw, how sweet. Didja buy me a ring to go with that confession?
Forsyth: Th-This is no time for jokes! I'm trying to say something, Python! I don't want to have to choose between my best friend and my dream. But it seems like all you do is poke fun at me for following it. I wouldn't put up with that if it was from anyone else.
Python: ...Hey, buddy, I was just japin' ya. I'm sorry, yeah? I know this knight stuff's important to you.
Forsyth: And when you don't try--well, it looks bad on me as your lieutenant. Especially because I know you're capable of so much more.
Python: Aw, cut it out, you're gonna make me blush. I'm surprised you even still believe in me after all these years of disappointing you.
Forsyth: Of course I do, Python. I like to think the things I believe in aren't hopeless.
Python: Hey... listen. I do have a dream. Just a little one.
Forsyth: You do?
Python: When the war's over... you, me, a bottle of wine, a grand old time. How's that sound?
Forsyth: It sounds like a plan to me! Now--you'd better start working towards it! No slacking off!
Python: Heh. Aye-aye, cap'n. I'll give it my all.

Lukas: It strikes me as unwise for you to have your head in a book at a time like this.
Forsyth: Y-yes, you're probably right. But I swear I'm paying attention to the battle! Please don't tell Sir Clive about this.
Lukas: Peace, friend. I was just looking out for you. If I may, which lierary work has so enraptured your interest?
Forsyth: Oh, this? It's an old tactical codex. My father lent it to me when I left home. ...Well, it's more like I took it. My father is a scholar, so I spent my childhood surrounded by books.
Lukas: Really? I didn't know. That must have been wonderful. I do enjoy a good page-turner.
Forsyth: Yes, I've noticed that you're something of an avid reader.
Lukas: Guilty as charged. My father wouldn't have it, though. He insisted I train in the arts of war. What I wouldn't have given for just one full day curled up with a good book.
Forsyth: Really? Well, that's[Beat]one way to look at it, I suppose. ......

## ForsythLukas_B
Lukas: Forsyth, do you have a moment?
Forsyth: Of course! What is it, Lukas?
Lukas: Remember when I was telling you about my father forcing me to train? I couldn't help but notice it upset you. So I was hoping to clear the air.
Forsyth: Er, sorry. Was it that obvious? Well, all right. We can clear the air. Let's see... How do I put this... Since I was small, all I've ever wanted was to become a knight. But my father insisted I wield a pen, and barred me from the sword or lance. I lost out on some of the best years for training as I sat inside studying my days away. Sometimes I fear I'm only playing catch-up with warriors like you and Sir Clive...
Lukas: Ah, so we were quite different.
Forsyth: I would have given anything for the opportunities your father gave you. So it hurt when you said you'd rather read. Books are easy to find, after all.
Lukas: Heh heh. Well, I still would have gladly traded places with you. Whoever dealt life's cards was clearly sloshed to the gills.
Forsyth: Ha ha. Indeed.

## ForsythLukas_A
Lukas: *sigh* Really, Forsyth? Reading in the heat of battle again? One day this will get you killed.
Forsyth: Wagh! Lukas! What a surprise! ...You look well.
Lukas: Mm-hmm. What are you reading today?
Forsyth: Oh, this old tome? Merely a chronicle of Zofian history. I started mixing up my reading list after our last chat.
Lukas: Really? Why is that?
Forsyth: You convinced me I was being a fool. As a boy, I told myself the only books I had use for were combat manuals. I passed up countless valuable lessons just to prove a point to my father. Now I'm trying to serve as lieutenant to Sir Clive, and look at me! Every day is a painful reminder of just how little I actually know.
Lukas: Nonsense. ...Though if it makes you feel better, I have just as many regrets. Every time I barely escape with my life in battle, I curse myself for not taking my early training more seriously. But at least time is on our side. It's never too late to learn, after all.
Forsyth: You're right--a warrior can be a scholar as well. ...You know what Lukas? I'm going to KEEP reading this book. And if the enemy comes at me, I'll be ready to stab them with KNOWLEDGE!
Lukas: Heh heh. If they don't knight you for that, then something is clearly wrong.

Forsyth: Wait... Is that him? It is! [bounce] Sir Clive! Sir Cliiiive!
Clive: Ah, Forsyth. How fare you?
Forsyth: Never better, sir! I could take on a whole army, so I could! Just watch as I secure us a grand victory in your name, sir!
Clive: Splendid. Er, but while I appreciate your enthusiasm, I have a small request: Please DO NOT run headlong into the enemy's ranks again. How many times now have we had to save you because you got separated?
Forsyth: [bounce] Eeep! Yes, sir. S-sorry, sir. I will strive to do better, sir! And if I fail to learn my lesson, then I am prepared to die a warrior's death for my mistakes!
Clive: Let us hope it does not come to that. You know, you have tremendous talent, Forsyth, but you are far too tense. Perhaps you should attempt to... loosen up.
Forsyth: L-loosen up, sir? [bounce] A-all right, sir! I'll work on that right away! Just watch how loose I can be! In the name of Zofia, you'll never see another soldier so limber as I!
Clive: ...Perhaps I am wasting my time.
[X]

## ForsythClive_B
Clive: Ah, Forsyth. You're in fine form today.
Forsyth: Sir Clive! Not half as fine a form as you, sir! Never fear--I intend to slay as many foes as possible in your good name! Long live the Deliverance, and three huzzahs for Sir Clive!
Clive: Uh, yes. Very good. Listen, Forsyth... I couldn't help but eavesdrop when you and Python were talking. You do know that you can speak to me the same as you do to him, yes?
Forsyth: Forgive me, sir, but I'm not certain that I grasp your meaning.
Clive: With Python, you open up and speak your mind. You're friendly. Relaxed. That's what I meant when I said you can loosen up. Just treat me the same as you would a friend.
Forsyth: EXACTLY the same, sir? Uhhh... True, I grew up with Python, but... well, you're the furthest thing from him I could imagine! Wisdom pours from your mouth where only filth pours from his! 
Clive: Uh... right. Perhaps I should be more direct... There's no need to flatter me at every turn, Forsyth. You've well proven your ability and worthiness for your position as Lieutenant. You needn't put me on a pedestal for fear of losing that. 
Forsyth: O-Oh... Do I seem insincere? It's hardly flattery if it's truly how I feel. Lieutenant or no, you're still the man I admire most. Forgive my coarse language, but it would be blasphemous for me to treat you the same as a knucklehead like Python.
Clive: ...Well, give my words some thought, Lieutenant. We're closer in rank now than you think, and it's my hope that we can work together as friends and equals.
Forsyth: Truly? [bounce] What an honor, sir! Then, I shall find a way to see it through!

## ForsythClive_A
Forsyth: Sir Clive?
Clive: Forsyth, what's wrong? You look distressed. What happened to your usual vim and vigor?
Forsyth: I'm sorry, sir. I tried to do as you said. And I mean, I tried EVERYTHING. But I just can't seem to make it work.
Clive: What are you talking about?
Forsyth: You know. Being...loose. You asked me to treat you the same way as I do Python, remember? But the only way I could do it was to treat Python with MORE respect. And the filthy things that man says! ...We ended up coming to blows. Lukas had to step in and pull us apart. How can I ever treat him like you?
Clive: I... think you may have approached the problem the wrong way.
Forsyth: Sir Clive, why can't things just stay the way they are? You're the land's finest knight--strong, handsome, virtuous, a symbol of everything I've ever admired. And I know this is strange considering how long we've fought together, but I still get excited every time I have a chance to speak with you. If I seem tense or get carried away, it's probably because of that. Do you know what I mean?
Clive: Ah! Now we're getting somewhere.
Forsyth: Er... we are?
Clive: You're finally starting to open up! Just don't overthink it, all right. Also, I assure you that I'm not worthy of such levels of admiration. You've seen all the terrible mistakes I've made. I feel guilty being put on anyone's pedestal.
Forsyth: Nonsense, sir! True, losing Zofia Castle was a blow, and we've seen our share of failures. But I've watched you closely. Every time, you picked yourself up, dusted yourself off, and kept going. You're the reason we all still have hope! I WANT to put you on my pedestal! I want you pedestaled! Because it's my faith in you that gives me the courage to fight without fear. I know Alm may be our leader now... but you're still the banner we look to. You should remember that, sir.
Clive: I shall. Thank you, Forsyth. And forgive me for asking you to change who you are. I realize now that you're already the sort of man the Deliverance needs.
Forsyth: Y-you mean it, sir? Oh, thank you! You honor me!

## ForsythClair_C
Clair: What is that delectable smell? Why, if I didn't know better, I'd think someone was baking lemon squares...
Forsyth: Wagh! L-Lady Clair! What a surprise! I was, ah, just helping out in the mess tent in a way that certainly does not interfere with my duties as lieutenant! P-Please don't tell Sir Clive about this!
Clair: Oh, do calm yourself, Forsyth! I won't breathe a word of this to my brother. That is, if you'd be so kind as to share?
Forsyth: Well... I would feel a little silly eating these all myself. In truth, I did make these to share, but few people in the army seem to like sweets...
Clair: What a shame. I happen to love sweets. My brother isn't fond of them, so I always had to eat them by myself. It's good to have someone to share with! I simply must introduce you to the tea cakes at my manor!
Forsyth: You are too kind, Lady Clair! Oh, and, uhm, for the record-- what sort of food IS Sir Clive fond of?
Clair: Oh, well, he's got quite the refined palate... I happen to know that a slow-simmered beef roast with mushrooms is the stuff of his dreams!
Forsyth: Oh, er... meat. Right. That makes sense. 
Clair: Is there any particular reason you're asking, Forsyth? Have you decided to become the army cook, now?
Forsyth: N-Nope! No reason at all! Just, er, honing my out-of-battle skills!
[X]

## ForsythClair_B
Clair: My, that roast last night was superbly done! You're quite the capable chef, Forsyth!
Forsyth: Oh! Y-You think so? Well, I'm flattered, but I can't say I'm surprised. I most certainly got it right on the first try and not after a bit of trial and error!
Clair: Really, I'm awestruck at how well you balanced the flavors of the meat. Especially since I heard tell that you were a vegetarian...?
Forsyth: Ulp! I, er, that's not entirely untrue, but--
Clair: Hee hee. So it's no coincidence you asked after my brother's favorite food, then.
Forsyth: I, I simply wished to raise morale for our commander, of course!
Clair: Whyever are you so flustered, Forsyth? We both know the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach. It's perfectly all right to have a crush on my brother--he _is_ the finest knight in all the land.
Forsyth: W-What are you talking about?! I don't have a _crush!_ Sure, I think about him night and day and my heart flutters whenever he's near and I'm in awe of his sultry voice and handsome face but that doesn't mean I have a _crush_. That's ridiculous!
Clair: Oh, Forsyth, you are so much fun to tease!

[MidLeft]
Huff... Wheeze... Gods, this[NL]
mountain air is making me light-headed...[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadAtlas]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Hey, are you doing all right?
Need some help?
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Gaah! Don't sneak up on me like that![AN]
[MidRight]
Uh... woah, sorry. Seriously, are you OK?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
[MidLeft]
I look like something the cat spat up,
that's what's going on--
Give me a minute to freshen up--
There. Yes. I'm fine. Winded, but fine.
[MidRight]
That's a relief. Don't push yourself
too hard, OK? It's pretty easy to
lose your breath when you're not
used to high altitudes.
We don't get a lot of visitors
up here, so it's my job to keep
the mountain safe when one comes along.
[MidLeft]
I'd imagine not. Everything I saw in the
shops was, er... rustic, let's say.
Not exactly... on trend.
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Why would you waste time in the shops
when there's all this fresh mountain air?
Cold, clear streams, plenty of good hunting,
lots of trees to climb and caves to explore...
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Blegh. Look, I'm not an outdoorsy guy.
I just want to keep moseying along
until I can find somewhere with proper
amenities and not look like the
sweaty rear end of a mountain goat.
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Oh! Did I mention the hot springs?
That's a really good way to freshen
up after a hike. All-natural, good stuff.
A little herbal soap and boom!
Good as new!
[MidLeft]
...Excuse me?
[MidRight]
It's not too far from the village.
Seriously, if the hike is getting
to you, it'd do you some good.
[MidLeft]
Well, uh... you're... certainly
speaking my language. All right--
I'll bite. Count me in.

## LeonAtlas_B

[MidRight][LoadLeon]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hey, Leon! Man, that shot you made
earlier was great! I wanted to ask--
do you hunt much?
[MidRight]
Oh... now and then. I actually don't
eat meat, but selling game at the
market's a good bit of spare cash.
Why do you ask?
[MidLeft]
Oh, well, uh... I've never had much
luck hunting with a bow. My brothers
and I all LOVE meat, but I can never
get enough from trapping to feed us
all. I was hoping you could teach me
a few tricks. Maybe we could go
hunting together.
[MidRight]
Is that so... [ToggleSmile]That sounds like an 
awful lot of time traipsing around
in the grimy wilderness for a bunch
of food I won't even eat.
What's in it for me?
[MidLeft]
...Well, what do you like to eat?
You strike me as kind of a fancy city guy.
...Uh... do city guys like truffles?
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Gods, do you know how much
those things sell for at market?!
[MidLeft]
...No? They grow in my backyard...
I've always just had 'em for free.
But hey, if you want some,
be my guest! [ToggleSmile] I mean...
my backyard isn't TOO grimy.
Uh... I think.
[MidRight]
...Look, Atlas, I'm flattered, but I
kind of already have someone I'm...
you know. Holding out for.
[MidLeft]
...Huh? What do you mean?
[MidRight]
What do I-- Oh, bless your heart.
First you invite me to the hot spring.
Then you invite me to your house.
Now you're talking about just
GIVING me some truffles that are
worth HUNDREDS at market.
Hundreds! You know, in the civilized world,
we call that "courtship".
[MidLeft]
Uh... What? I'm not sure I--
[MidLeft]
...Seriously? Don't tell me--
Ugghhh! Every SINGLE time.
Either he turns out straight,
or he turns out dead!
I am SO OVER IT!
[ClearFace]

...What the heck was THAT all about?

## LeonAtlas_A
[MidLeft][LoadLeon]
[FarFarRight][LoadAtlas]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
...Hey, Leon?
[MidLeft]
Oh... Atlas. Listen, I...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know I'm a drama queen sometimes, but
that was... particularly dramatic of me.
[MidRight]
Hey, no worries. I'm not upset.
Just a little... confused.
What was that thing about
"straight guys" you said?
[MidLeft]
Oh... I just have bad luck in
the romance department, I guess.
It's nothing you need to worry
your pretty little head about.
[MidRight]
Well, if it's upsetting you
so much, I don't think it's
"nothing". I may not know a 
whole lot about this kind of
stuff, but I can always listen.
[MidLeft]
...If you really want to know...
I've been in love a couple times.
In fact, I joined the army because
my first partner and I, we were going
to see the world together. We had all
these hopes and dreams--and then he...
our first battle was his last one.
Just like that, he was gone.
[MidRight]
...That's awful...
If something like that happened to
someone I loved, I'd want to go
rip some heads off.
[MidLeft]
I was a wreck. I cried so much I
thought my eyeballs would float
out of my skull. And then... 
I met the most wonderful man.
Valbar. Every time he saw me,
he'd take the time to say something
to cheer me up. He had everything
I wanted--kindness, strength, 
mature, yet boyishly innocent...
a real good listener... 
aaaand a wife and kids.
I knew he'd never be into me like
that, but how could I NOT fall for
someone with all that going for him?
[MidRight]
I... guess that makes sense.
The mountain's never given me any
heartache like that, so I wouldn't
know--but that sounds pretty rough.
[MidLeft]
Oh, don't take this as me whining.
I'm happy to feel for him what I do.
But I'd be lying if I said it didn't
still sting to fall for someone who
just isn't made to love you that way.
And, to be frank--it feels like that's
happening all over again.
Me finding some wonderful guy that
it just can't work out with.
That's why I got all catty at you.
I let my guard down and got my
hopes up. It's nothing you did wrong.
[MidRight]
...
[MidLeft]
You know what-- never mind.
It's a lot to dump on you all at once.
[MidRight]
Leon... hey.
Maybe I don't know much this stuff.
Love, and all that. But--
when the war's done, come
up to the mountain.
[MidLeft]
...Do you really mean that?
[MidRight]
Of course. A good long hike can
put all that behind you. [ToggleSmile]
I mean, I spend all my time up there
and you don't see ME worrying about
heartache, do you?
[MidLeft]
Hahaha...
You know... maybe I COULD get used
to a little gravel in my boots
once in a while.
