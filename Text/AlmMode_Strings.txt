You just said I can fend for myself![AN]

Good day.[.5] You must be Sir Mycen's grandson.[NL]
Alm, was it?[.5] My name is Lukas.[AN]
I fight for the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The [0x93]Deliverance[0x94]?[.5] What's that?[NL]
Aren't you one of the Knights of Zofia?[AN]
The king's knights?[A]

Oh, I see.[.5] I suppose that means word hasn't[NL]

In that case, please forgive me for[NL]

[LoadOverworldFaces]
King Lima IV is dead.[AN]
He met his end some days ago at[NL]
the hands of Chancellor Desaix.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[NL]
You're saying it was regicide?![AN]
[MidRight]
I fear so.[AN]
It seems Desaix sold Zofia,[NL]
and his soul, to the Rigelian Empire.[AN]
He has been inflicting cruelties[NL]
upon those loyal to the King,[AN]
and some of the Zofian Knights[NL]
split off into a resistance force.[AN]
That would be the Deliverance.[AN]
However, our situation is dire.[NL]
We need a hero's aid.[AN]
And so I have come to the home of one[NL]
of Zofia's greatest heroes: Sir Mycen.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.5]

Do you see, Alm?[AN]

You're volunteering to go to war![AN]

Sir Mycen has been teaching me to[NL]
use a blade since I was a boy.[AN]
And not just that.[.5] He also taught me[NL]

He has a hero's blood in him.[AN]
His presence is sure to raise[NL]

And for my part, I'm curious to see[NL]
what a self-proclaimed warrior can do.[AN]
Especially now that he'll be[NL]
doing it for the Deliverance.[AN]

And you'll be given a[NL]

And what brings you here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Need you even ask?[NL]
When I heard you had been taken[AN]
prisoner, I mounted my finest[NL]

Sir Clive couldn't leave the[NL]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

behind.[.5] Who is this rabble?[AN]
[FarRight]
Um, are you talking about us?[AN]

They are not [0x93]rabble[0x94], Fernand.[AN]
This boy is Alm.[.5] He is the[NL]
grandson of Sir Mycen himself.[AN]

You were ordered to[NL]

Sadly, Sir Mycen was not[NL]

However, Alm and his friends have[NL]
joined our cause in his stead.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft]
Is this some absurd jest, Lukas?[AN]
Such baseborn curs cannot[NL]
possibly aid our cause.[AN]

[FarRight]
Fernand, please listen to reason.[AN]
These [0x93]curs[0x94] you so easily[NL]

In fact, without Alm, we might not[NL]
have retaken the Southern Outpost.[AN]

I beg your pardon?[AN]
Do I look like a man who listens[NL]
to the opinions of peasants?[AN]

Then you can listen to me, because[NL]
I happen to agree with him.[AN]
My brother already explained[NL]
this to you, did he not?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sir Clive?[NL]
What exactly did he explain?[AN]
[Right]
[0x93]A soldier's worth is not determined[NL]
by the station of his birth.[AN]
If we do not all fight together as one,[NL]
then we will never defeat Desaix.[0x94][AN]
Those are wise words.[NL]

But you WILL learn your place![AN]
Now, Clair.[AN]
Seeing as you are safe, you have[NL]
no need for these people.[AN]
Come, let us return.[.5] We must report[NL]
this matter to Sir Clive at once.[AN]

I will do no such thing![NL]
I'm going with Alm.[AN]

every bit as hard as he would have.[AN]
[Beat]Or harder![.4] I just don't want[NL]
you to think[Beat] I mean, he's not--[AN]
[MidRight]
Peace, Alm.[.5] I understand.[AN]
None here would dare think[NL]
your grandfather craven.[AN]
That being said, I would beg[NL]
a boon of you.[AN]
The same one I had hoped to ask[NL]
of Sir Mycen, in fact.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Please, go on.[.5] If it's[NL]
within my power, I'll do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then I shall state it plain.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
I would like you to become the[NL]
new leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
WHAAAT?![.4] I mean[Beat]um[Beat]what?[NL]
I'm not a leader![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadFernand]
[FarLeft]
Clive![.4] Have you taken leave[NL]
of your senses?[AN]
[MidRight]
This needs to happen, Fernand.[NL]
You know it as well as I.[AN]
Most of our volunteers are[NL]
of common birth.[AN]
We share a cause, but little else.[AN]
I know not how to speak[NL]
to their hearts.[AN]
Sir Mycen began as a common soldier[NL]
before rising to a knight and count.[AN]
His story resonates with these people.[AN]
Do you not agree that his grandson is[NL]
just the banner they would rally to?[AN]
[FarLeft]
What fool would agree with that?![AN]
If some ungrateful peasant won't[NL]
heed your command,[AN]
you sweep him aside![AN]
[MidRight]
Think, Fernand![.4] Our finest knight[NL]
is now a prisoner of war.[AN]
To fill the gap she left behind,[AN]
can we truly afford to turn away[NL]
able soldiers?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ngh[Beat][AN]
[Left]
I, for one, think[NL]
it's a fine idea.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You too...?![AN]
[Left]
Knights have no monopoly on skill,[NL]
and Alm is as able a fighter as any.[AN]
Clive has done all he can to hold[NL]
the Deliverance together thus far,[AN]
but if our ship is astray,[NL]
then we must chart a new course.[AN]
Alm is that course.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What, do you fancy yourself[NL]
Clive's new confidant now?![AN]
I'll rip that traitorous tongue[NL]
from your throat![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Then you'll finally have[NL]
the truth in your grasp![AN]
I lost friends at the Outpost.[NL]
Veteran men, yet dead all the same.[AN]
We MUST adapt so we might end this[NL]
war as quickly as possible.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Left][LoadAlm]
[LoadOverworldFaces]

Please, just[Beat]hold on a second.[AN]
I know I said I would do anything[NL]
in my power, but I can't--[AN]
[MidRight]
I understand what you can[NL]
and cannot do, Alm.[AN]
My lieutenants and I would continue[NL]
to handle day-to-day affairs.[AN]
We only need you to do one thing:[NL]
lead.[AN]
You would be inspiring the troops[NL]
and revitalizing the army.[AN]
You are Sir Mycen's grandson.[NL]
I know you to be capable of such.[AN]
[Left]
I'm not so sure[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft][LoadClair]
[FarLeft]
Please, Alm.[.5] For me.[NL]
For all of us.[AN]
My brother tries to hide it,[AN]
but I know the anxiety of Mathilda's[NL]
capture takes a toll on him.[AN]
You can relieve him of at least[NL]
a portion of that burden.[AN]
[Left]
I want to, but[Beat][AN]
[Beat] [Beat][NL]
[Beat]All right.[AN]
If you think me worthy,[NL]
then I won't let you down.[AN]
[MidRight]
Are you certain?[AN]
Then thank you, Alm.[NL]
Thank you.[AN]
[Left]
Just[Beat] please, keep your[NL]
expectations low.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha! As you wish.[AN]
[FarLeft]
This could change everything[Beat][AN]
The boy will make a splendid[NL]
leader![.4] Simply splendid![AN]

Pah! Damn that Mycen[NL]

Nobility cannot be [0x93]earned[0x94]--[AN]
nor can it be passed down[NL]
to some mongrel grandchild![AN]
You are far too soft[NL]
to lead this army, Clive,[AN]
and I've lost my taste[NL]
for it long ago.[AN]
[MidRight]
You know as well as I that[NL]
we are both too deep in grief[AN]
to captain the Deliverance ourselves.[AN]
I KNOW I cannot lead--[.4]which is why[NL]
we must take this chance.[AN]
[Left]
How can you still call it[NL]
the [0x93]Deliverance[0x94]?![AN]
We were supposed to be[NL]
a band of noble knights.[AN]
United in purpose![NL]
Upholding a tradition![AN]
Restoring the old order to Zofia![AN]
Now we have nothing but a militia[AN]
full of baseborn serfs[NL]
trying to lord over us.[AN]
Like your lieutenant Forsyth.[AN]
Or that Python--[NL]
true to his name, he is![AN]
[MidRight]
They have both proven themselves[NL]
on the battlefield time and again![AN]
Are you suggesting I deny my men[NL]
reward for their achievements?[AN]
What morale would they have then?![NL]
The damned army wouldn't function![AN]
Hear me, Fernand.[.5] Hear me well.[AN]
I know you have your reasons for[NL]
closing your heart to common folk.[AN]
But please, for the sake of our[NL]
ideals, you MUST think past them.[AN]
[Left][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
No, Clive.[.5] I will not.[NL]
I would rather die than kneel[AN]
to some whelp who was[NL]
birthed in the hay.[AN]
Today we part ways for good.[AN]
I am finished with you[NL]
and your [0x93]Deliverance.[0x94][AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
