Good.[.4] You're all here.[NL]
Let's be on our way.[AN]
[Right]
Uhm[Beat][NL]
Are you sure about this, Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Am I sure about what?[AN]
[Right]
Oh, please.[.4] About Celica![AN]
You finally see her after gods-know[NL]
how long, and you end up in a spat?[AN]
[MoveRight]Hey, don't give me that look--[NL]
she clearly took off in a right huff.[AN]
You two used to be inseparable.[NL]
What happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That was a long time ago, Tobin.[NL]
A lot's happened--[.4]to both of us.[AN]
[Right]
Well, I'm no expert, but I think[NL]
a normal person would just apologize.[AN]
I'm sure she hasn't gotten too far yet,[NL]
what with those skinny legs and all...[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Seriously, Tobin? Y-[.4]you're passing out[NL]
relationship advice now?[AN]
Give it a rest--[AN]
it's not like every fight has a[NL]
right side and a wrong side.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
Get over it, Gray.[NL]
I'm well aware of that![AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
Well, this could be the last time[NL]
Alm and Celica see each other.[AN]
You'd think they'd wanna part on[NL]
a[Beat] less-sour note.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's all right, Tobin.[NL]
I appreciate what you're saying.[AN]
But this is something for me and[NL]
Celica to work out on our own.[AN]
Besides, I'm the leader[NL]
of the Deliverance now.[AN]
It wouldn't be right to keep everyone[NL]
waiting on my own private business.[AN]

Sir Alm! Our scouts have spied[NL]
Rigelian forces up ahead![AN]
[Right]
[Beat] ...Then the battle[NL]
begins here.[AN]
[FarRight]
So it seems.[AN]
The fights ahead will be nothing like[NL]
our skirmishes in the south.[AN]
You've wounded Rigel's pride, and[NL]
they will strike back without mercy.[AN]
But the spirit of Zofia[NL]
demands you prevail.[AN]
There's no turning back now.[AN]
[Right]
I know.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadClive]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Fernand?![AN]
You march beneath[NL]
Rigel's standard now?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Does that really surprise you, Clive?[AN]
You and the Deliverance took all I[NL]
believed in and trod it into the mire.[AN]
In Rigel, they still have[NL]
ideals worth upholding.[AN]
[MidRight]
Damn you, Fernand![NL]
Listen to yourself![AN]
[FarLeft]
My king is dead.[NL]
My country fallen.[AN]
But I'll not hand this[NL]
land over to you.[AN]
Now, it is the Rigelian Empire's turn.[AN]
Lord Berkut shall lead us and[NL]
unite Valentia under one noble order![AN]
[MidRight]
Come to your senses, Fernand![AN]
You have always fought for[NL]
your motherland--for Zofia![AN]
[FarLeft]
Only one of us has lost[NL]
his senses, Clive.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Allow me to enlighten you.[AN]
That boy you have been[NL]
parading around as your new hero?[AN]
He was never Mycen's grandson.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
What is this folly?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Oh, I can assure you it is no folly.[AN]
My source has known[NL]
Sir Mycen for years.[AN]
The old knight has no family.[AN]
Perhaps he made some orphan his ward[NL]
so he wouldn't have to die alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
You lie...[AN]
And yet there is the matter of what[NL]
the old man at the castle said...[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha ha! Oh, Clive.[.5] You've become[NL]
the very picture of absurdity.[AN]
Once you were a man to whom the[NL]
lineage of our noble houses meant all.[AN]
But now you take for your future king[NL]
a boy you don't know from a gutter rat![AN][ToggleSmile]

Take this lance.[.5] It will help you[NL]
pierce heavy armor.[AN]
But be aware--[NL]
it's awfully heavy itself.[AN]
Be wary about what battles[NL]
you carry it into.[AN]

We've emerged victorious, but...[AN]

We can't rest on our laurels now.[NL]
Wouldn't you agree, Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
...Hmm?[NL][OpenEyes]
Oh, yes.[.5] Quite.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is it? You look shaken.[AN]
[Beat]Oh, right.[.5] Forgive me.[NL]
You and Fernand were good friends.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, it's not that...[NL][CloseEyes]
Well, it's not JUST that...[AN][HalfCloseEyes]

We've got the girl.[AN]

Master Tatarrah awaits your arrival[NL]
at the Sluice Gate.[AN]
Deliver the young mage to him,[NL]
and the Rigelian Army will be sure[AN]
to give you a prestigious title[NL]
for your service and loyalty.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Excellent...[.5] In the meantime,[NL]
I trust that you will be able to[AN]
torch this pitiful little hovel and its[NL]
surroundings without my assistance?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Do not underestimate us.[AN]
The Duma Faithful serve[NL]
the War Father directly[AN]
and are imbued with his power.[AN]
It would do you some good[NL]
to trust in our abilities.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, of course! I must admit,[AN]
I am eager to see the true power[NL]
of the War Father.[AN]
(Seeing as it was clearly too great[NL]
to waste on a single maiden[AN]
and a couple of mercenaries.)[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Run along now, rat.[AN]
Me and my men will make[NL]
quick work of this village,[AN]
and ensure that the mage champion's[NL]
bloodline can cause us no trouble.[AN]

May the blessings of Duma be upon you.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Alm, please.[.5] We can't spend time[NL]
chasing this hunch of yours further.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I swear, it sounded like someone[NL]
shouting for help.[AN]
I can't just let that go unheard.[AN]
[MidRight]
The weather and terrain offer such[NL]
poor visibility, though...[AN]
We have no way of knowing where[NL]
the assailant ran off to.[AN]
I hate to say it, but in these[NL]
conditions, the wisest choice[AN]
would be to give up and focus on[NL]
the march forward.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We can't ignore someone in need![NL]
I'm going in to investigate.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm, please-- the risk is too great.[AN]
How much more time will we lose[NL]
searching in this darkness?[AN]
We should either march forward,[NL]
or rest for the night[AN]
and search again come morning.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Listen, Clive-- I'm not doing this[NL]
as the leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
I'm doing this because it's[NL]
the right thing to do,[AN]
regardless of who comes along[NL]
to back me up.[AN]
If you think it's best to leave[NL]
me behind and march onward,[AN]
you're free to do so.[NL]
But I'm saving that girl![AN]

(gasp) You there![AN]
You're with the Deliverance,[NL]

[MidRight]
I am.[.5] Who are you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
My name is Luthier.[AN]
Merely a humble mage[NL]
from a humble village.[AN]
On this day, however, I cry your aid,[NL]
for my younger sister is in trouble![AN]
[MidRight]
What happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
First of all, you should know that[NL]
my sister is named Delthea.[AN]
She possesses magical potential beyond[NL]
that of any in our village.[AN]
One of Rigel's arcanists,[NL]
Tatarrah, caught wind of this[AN]
and had her kidnapped.[AN]
He's going to use his powers to[NL]
control her and make her guard[AN]
the northern sluice.[AN]
They plan to block the sluice until[NL]
it collapses and Zofia is flooded.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?![NL]
But that would be catastrophic![AN]
[MidLeft]
Indeed it would.[.5] Surely you're[NL]
planning to stop them, correct?[AN]
If so, I ask that you[NL]
also rescue my sister.[AN]
I'll even go with you if you like.[AN]
If we defeat Tatarrah, that will[NL]
release his hold on her.[AN]

a lady knight they're holding captive.[AN]
Desaix plans to put her to death soon[NL]
as an example to others...[AN]

What?![NL]
They intend to execute Mathilda?![AN]

If he puts Mathilda to the guillotine,[NL]
I...[.5] I don't know what I'll do.[AN]
We haven't time to waste.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hold on a moment...[.5] You were the one[NL]
saying we should give up on rescuing[AN]
the girl from this village.[AN]
Now we're to drop everything to rescue[NL]
Mathilda because she's special to you?[AN]
I understand how you feel--[NL]
I'll drop everything to save her--[AN]
but don't you think the village girl's[NL]
brother feels the same way about her?[AN]
[Right]
Well--[.5] I--[.5] That's different,[NL]

[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What the hell does that[NL]
have to do with it?![AN]
[Right]
Alm, what's gotten into you?![NL]
It's not even comparable![AN]
It's Mathilda who is the finest knight[NL]

A moment please, Alm.[.5] I have[NL]
a fresh report from our scouts.[AN]
Apparently, the enemy's main force has[NL]
retreated west through the forest.[AN]
But before we give chase,[NL]
we should deal with Desaix.[AN]
It wouldn't be wise to pass him by[NL]
while his fortress lies in reach.[AN]
[MidLeft]
All right, that makes sense.[NL]
But listen, Lukas...[AN]
Do you know anything about the[NL]
Rigelian general Fernand mentioned?[AN]
Berkut, I believe it was?[AN]
[Right]
Lord Berkut, yes.[.5] I am no stranger[NL]
to the rumors, at least.[AN]
They say he is about your age.[AN]
A talented young general[NL]
of royal blood...[AN]
It's no wonder Fernand is[NL]
so smitten with him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat][AN]
Does it really matter so much[NL]
where you're born,[AN]
or who your father was?[AN]

I beg your pardon?[AN]

Oh--sorry, I was just...[AN]
I don't meant to speak ill[NL]
of nobles or anything.[AN]
