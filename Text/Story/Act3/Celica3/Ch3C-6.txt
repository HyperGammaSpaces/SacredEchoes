At last, the valley approach.[AN]
Cross this, and we'll finally reach[NL]
the Earth Mother's temple.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadSaber]
Looks like my contract's[NL]
about to be up, then.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right...[.4] What you choose to do after we[NL]
reach the temple is yours to decide.[AN]
[Beat]Though, I'll certainly miss you.[AN]
I'd be happy to renegotiate[NL]
if you'd like to stay.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm. You said you didn't have any[NL]
proper family left, yeah?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's correct.[.4] My mother died[NL]
before I could remember her face.[AN]
I had an older brother, but he...[AN]
He perished in a house fire a few[NL]
years later.[.4] ...Why do you ask?[AN]
There's no possible connection.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I know.[.4] Wasn't my intent to pry.[NL]
[Beat]I do have a little sister, though.[AN]
Been years since I've seen her, but...[NL]
She looks a bit like you, that's all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Is that so?[AN]
Well, the brother I knew[NL]
wasn't that much older.[AN]
He'd only be about twenty[NL]
if he were alive today,[AN]
and clearly you've a few more[NL]
years than that behind you.[AN]
If that's all that's keeping you--[AN]
I don't want that to be[NL]
based on false pretenses.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's not. [.5][CloseEyes]Might as well come clean--[NL]
My sister's Rigelian, and so am I.[AN][OpenEyes]
Not that it makes much of a[NL]
difference to me either way.[AN]
What with being so close to the border,[NL]
I've been thinking about why I left.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to keep[NL]
going and pay my sister a visit.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] a nice thought.[NL]
I'm glad to hear it.[AN]
As we agreed at port, you're free[NL]
to go once we reach the temple.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Take heart, everyone.[NL]
We're nearly there.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadBlake]
Aye, but are you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Who-- [NL]
[MoveMidLeft]Oh, by the Mother![AN]
What are Rigelian forces[NL]
doing all the way out here?[AN]
[FarRight]
Pray think on it for a moment.[NL]
I'm sure the answer will come to you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No. [.4]No, that can't...[AN]
[FarRight]
You're a priestess, aye?[AN]
Other of your kind have tried to cross[NL]
this valley and seek Mila's blessing.[AN]
But nary a one of them have completed[NL]
the journey in one piece.[AN]
Ignorance is a pitiable thing,[NL]
aye, so it is.[AN]
Doubly so when it's the very Mother[NL]
who's responsible for your suffering...[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is that supposed to mean?[AN]
[FarRight]
Why waste time explaining[NL]
when you're about to be dead[AN]
like all the rest?![AN]

What are you waiting for?[AN]
Soon you'll all serve as[NL]
scabbards for my sword![AN]

Damn... [CloseEyes]You're stronger[NL]

Shame you're too late...[NL]
Mila is[Beat]already...[AN]

I heard there's great flyin' beasts[NL]
in them thar caves.[AN]
They come from the Dragon Shrine[NL]
further up in the mountains.[AN]
You lot look like you've got some[NL]
good shots in your ranks--[AN]
why not give this longbow a go[NL]
at shootin' them down?[AN]

Only one of Zofia's royal bloodline[NL]
can open the temple's sluice gate.[AN]
With His Highness Lima IV deceased,[NL]
who is left to take his place?[AN]
What's more, I hear the western gate[NL]
has been occupied by Rigelian forces.[AN]
At this rate, Zofia is at risk of[NL]
a flood like we've never seen before.[AN]
Please, take this ring.[AN]
If worst comes to worst, it's said[NL]
to protect against drowning.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadMae]
Dangit, I hate it when they die right[NL]
before they say something important![AN]
What do you think, Celica?[AN]
What beans was he[NL]
about to spill there?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know. But whatever it was,[NL]
I don't like it.[AN]
We must hurry to the temple.[AN]
