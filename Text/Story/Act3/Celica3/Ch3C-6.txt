At last, the valley approach.[AN]
Cross this, and we'll finally reach[NL]
the Earth Mother's temple.[AN]
Take heart, everyone.[NL]
We're nearly there.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadBlake]
Aye, but are you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Who-- [NL]
[MoveMidLeft]Oh, by the Mother![AN]
What are Rigelian forces[NL]
doing all the way out here?[AN]
[FarRight]
Pray think on it for a moment.[NL]
I'm sure the answer will come to you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No. [.4]No, that can't...[AN]
[FarRight]
You're a priestess, aye?[AN]
Other of your kind have tried to cross[NL]
this valley and seek Mila's blessing.[AN]
But nary a one of them have completed[NL]
the journey in one piece.[AN]
Ignorance is a pitiable thing,[NL]
aye, so it is.[AN]
Doubly so when it's the very Mother[NL]
who's responsible for your suffering...[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is that supposed to mean?[AN]
[FarRight]
Why waste time explaining[NL]
when you're about to be dead[AN]
like all the rest?![AN]

I heard there's great flyin' beasts[NL]
in them thar caves.[AN]
They come from the Dragon Shrine[NL]
further up in the mountains.[AN]
You lot look like you've got some[NL]
good shots in your ranks--[AN]
why not give this longbow a go[NL]
at shootin' them down?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadWoman]
Only one of Zofia's royal bloodline[NL]
can open the temple's sluice gate.[AN]
With His Highness Lima IV deceased,[NL]
who is left to take his place?[AN]
What's more, I hear the western gate[NL]
has been occupied by Rigelian forces.[AN]
At this rate, Zofia is at risk of[NL]
a flood like we've never seen before.[AN]
Please, take this ring.[AN]
If worst comes to worst, it's said[NL]
to protect against drowning.[AN]

Dangit, I hate it when they die right[NL]
before they say something important![AN]
What do you think, Celica?[AN]
What beans was he[NL]
about to spill there?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know. But whatever it was,[NL]
I don't like it.[AN]
We must hurry to the temple.[AN]
