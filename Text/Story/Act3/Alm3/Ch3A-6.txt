...That's the last of them, sir.[AN]
Every cellar, silo and smokehouse[NL]
up in flames. They'll never recover.[AN]
[Right]
That'll smoke these Zofian vermin[NL]
out of their hiding spots.[AN]
Then they'll know what happens when[NL]
they don't give us a proper welcome.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]
They'll give up that Holy Bow[NL]
one way or another.[AN]
The gods fear my name--[.4]Gazelle![NL]
My marksmanship is peerless![AN]
And if I want this bow,[NL]
then this bow I shall have.[AN]

[Left][MoveLeft]
The village! It's burnt down![NL]
The Rigelians wouldn't go THAT far--[AN]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
...I fear they already have.[AN][OpenEyes]
This is war, Alm. It's only going to[NL]
get worse from here.[AN]
[Left]
How can that dastard call himself a[NL]
knight?! This is criminal!![AN]
[FarLeft]
Fairytales of knightly jousts and the[NL]
chivalric code are sadly not reality.[AN]
Some men have no honor, no matter[NL]
their rank or title.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Everyone![NL]
Save the surrounding villages![AN]
I'll deal with this cad myself[NL]
if I have to![AN]

You have taken your last[NL]
step in this realm.[AN]
Now prepare to[NL]
visit the next![AN]

## Ch3_6A_GazelleDeath
[MidLeft][LoadGazelle]
To die at the hands of[NL]
worthless vermin...[AN][CloseEyes]
How shameful...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadMoneyman]
The Rigelians have attacked this place[NL]
many times before, but never like this.[AN]
If our meager gold's to be taken,[NL]
we'd rather it go to the Deliverance.[AN]
Use it well, and drive those[NL]
Rigelians out for us all![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
[MidRight][LoadOldwoman]
I can't thank you enough for[NL]
coming to our aid.[AN]
The Rigelian incursions have been[NL]
worsening daily, here by the border.[AN]
But the knight from today brought with[NL]
him a whole new level of brutality.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The village west of here...[NL]
I couldn't[Beat] get there in time.[AN]
I wasn't fast enough,[NL]
or strong enough, or...[AN]
[MidRight]
...It's true, there were casualties.[NL]
Although lives were lost, hope is not.[AN]
Many of them had already found safe[NL]
shelter here before the fire spread.[AN]
We'll open our doors to our neighbors[NL]
and rebuild together.[AN]
[Beat]We'd like you to have this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
This is...![AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, the bow the Rigelians sought[NL]
and spilled blood for.[AN]
Take this bow in their honor.[NL]
May Mila's blessings be upon you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you[Beat] truly. I promise[NL]
I'll put it to good use.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadBerkut]
[Right][LoadRudolf]
Back so soon, Berkut?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sire, I was merely--[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Right]
Are the tales true? You challenged the[NL]
Deliverance for sport and lost?[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Forgive me, Uncle.[.4][OpenEyes] They proved to be[NL]
more skilled than I first imagined.[AN]
[Right]
Hmm...[AN]
[FarRight][LoadJedah][ToggleSmile]
What a most distressing turn of events.[AN]
Our own Lord Berkut, broken by a[NL]
band of farmers and cowhands.[AN]
Did you mean to drag your knights'[NL]
honor through the dung whilst playing?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Hold your tongue![AN]
You are a servant to our house,[NL]
and you dare insult Rigel's finest?[AN]
It's far more sensible for clods such[NL]
as you to stay cowering in your robes.[AN]
[FarRight]
You forget that we answer to none[NL]
but Duma, father of all Rigel.[AN]
Though I may be a servant,[NL]
it is certainly not to you.[AN]
We shall see who cowers in the end.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What are you implying?[AN]
[FarRight]
Emperor Rudolf, allow me to[NL]
put your heart at ease.[AN]
It is true that the Deliverance is[NL]
nearing the sluice gate at our border.[AN]
However, it is guarded by Tatarrah,[NL]
one of the Duma Faithful's finest.[AN]
And as I understand it, he has[NL]
come across a most interesting toy.[AN]
I have the utmost faith he will[NL]
make short work of those rebels.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][MoveMidLeft]Sire![AN]
[Right]
What now, Berkut?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tatarrah may yet fail. Permit me[NL]
to take my men to the border.[AN]
If the Deliverance does break past[NL]
the sluice, they must reckon with me![AN]
[Right][CloseEyes]
Mmm...[AN]
[MidLeft]
This time, I will smash their puny[NL]
rebellion once and for all.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
I swear it![AN]
You must give me one last chance![AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
...Very well.[AN]
If they try to set foot on our land,[NL]
they are to pay dearly.[AN]
Am I understood?[AN]
[FarRight]
What silliness.[AN]
The rebels will be dead long before[NL]
they reach the border. Heh heh heh...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Rrghh...[AN]

[CloseEyes]
Urgh...[AN]
[FarRight][LoadRinea]
Berkut, my lord.[AN]
Have you finished your report[NL]
to the emperor?[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
Yes. We march for the border.[AN]
[FarRight]
Again?[NL]
But we only just returned home...[AN]
[Right]
It was my choice--[.4]I had to beg the[NL]
emperor for a chance at redemption.[AN][MoveRight]
All because of that maggot, Alm![NL]
Because of him,[AN]
I had to sit there while that snake[NL]
Jedah spat venom at me...[AN][Right][MoveRight]
I will make him pay for[NL]
this disgrace a hundredfold![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadNuibaba]
Why, Lord Berkut.[NL]
What grieves you?[AN]
[Right][HalfCloseEyes]
Ugh, Nuibaba. Not you...[AN]
[MidLeft]
These halls have been dark without your[NL]
unique fire to light them, my lord.[AN]
I shall treasure this meeting when I[NL]
return to my post on Fear Mountain.[AN]
Master Jedah honors me. ...Yet I hear[NL]
he has not done the same for you.[AN]
Perhaps because of your...[AN][ToggleSmile]
embarrassing loss at the hands of[NL]
those rebel scum?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Right][OpenEyes]
You Faithful are in dire need of a[NL]
lesson on how to speak to nobility.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And I am certain you would be[NL]
a most fearsome teacher.[AN]
Regardless, you wrong me, Lord Berkut.[NL]
I merely wish to aid you.[AN]
[Right]
Heh. How could YOU help ME?[AN]
All of you claw at the heels of your[NL]
god while ignoring his first teaching.[AN]
He wished for men to be strong![NL]
Not a pack of supplicating fools.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you do not need our power?[NL]
...I see.[AN]
Then I pray you fare well in your[NL]
battle at the border.[AN][CloseEyes]
For should you lose...[AN][OpenEyes]
well, I doubt your uncle would[NL]
give you a third chance.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Or is this the fourth?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Right]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
For all your stubborn words,[NL]
you have some wisdom.[AN]
You have seen what the Faithful[NL]
are capable of in battle. I know it.[AN]
Father Duma's power is vast,[NL]
and not to be looked down upon.[AN]
Yes, it's true--[.4]Marla and Hestia both.[AN]
In turn, the Father rewarded[NL]
Lord Jedah with incredible magic.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
His own daughters? How dreadful![AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you see now, Lord Berkut?[NL][HalfCloseEyes]
Come to my abode...[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Never.[AN]
Victory over Alm would mean nothing[NL]
if not won by my own hand.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
So prideful! ...Very well.[AN]
We shall see how far[NL]
you get without my help.[AN]
If you find yourself in doubt,[NL]
however... my offer remains open.[AN]
You know where to find me.[AN][ClearFace]
[Right][CloseEyes]
Grrh... Accursed witch.[AN]
