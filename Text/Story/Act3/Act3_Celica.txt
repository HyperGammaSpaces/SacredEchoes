[MidLeft][LoadCelica][HalfCloseEyes]
Phew...[AN]
[Right]
Celica! [MoveRight]Hey, Celica![AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Hmm?[.4] I'm sorry, Mae.[NL]
I was lost in thought.[AN]
Did you need something?[AN]
[Right]
Me?[.4] Naw, I'm fine like always.[NL]
But what about YOU?![AN]
That guy leading the Deliverance is[NL]
a friend of yours, right?[AN]
I know we're in a rush, but surely we[NL]
had time for you to say good-bye![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
It's fine.[.4] That isn't necessary.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
But Celi--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mae, I need to reach the Temple[NL]
of Mila as soon as possible.[AN]
I know the Mother will reveal[NL]
a path to save Zofia[AN]
that doesn't involve violence.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadBoey]
[Right]
I dunno about this, Boey[Beat][NL]
Celica's acting all weird.[AN]
I wonder what happened?[AN]
[FarRight]
Well, can you blame her? I'm sure[NL]
she's more than a little conflicted.[AN]
If the Deliverance defeats Desaix and[NL]
drives the empire back, what next?[AN]
Zofia will need a ruler,[AN]
and who better than a boy who[NL]
cast off tyranny's yoke?[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
What?![.4] But Celica's[NL]
the rightful heir![AN]
[FarRight]
Yeah, but she can't exactly just go[NL]
and announce that to everyone.[AN]
If she did, she'd be made to lead[NL]
the Deliverance effort herself.[AN]
Believe me, that's the last thing[NL]
Celica wants right now.[AN]
[Right]
I hate it when you make sense, Boey.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But that just means we have to[NL]
haul tail to the Temple of Mila![AN]
The Earth Mother will know what to do.[NL]
She'll take care of everything![AN]
[FarRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
I pray it's truly so simple.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Once we cross this mountain,[NL]
we'll finally reach the coast.[AN]
It's a hard climb,[NL]
but I know we'll make it.[AN]

[FarRight][MoveFarFarRight][FarFarRight][ClearFace]

Look out! The cliff is crumbling![AN]
[Left][LoadBoey][MoveLeft]
Oh, you have to be joking![AN]
As if anything else could have gone[NL]
wrong on this blasted adventure![AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Everyone, be careful![NL]
Stay low to the ground![AN]

## Ch3_Celica_Start_3
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[MidRight][LoadConrad]
Are you unhurt?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wh-[.4]Who are you?[AN]
[MidRight]
My identity is of no consequence.[NL]
All that matters is that you're safe.[AN]
I came to warn you of the fault line[NL]
that crosses this pass--[.4]but alas,[AN]
my steed was no match for the speed[NL]
of a force of nature.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
And am I meant to accept that as[NL]
the entire story here?[AN]
I've been pursued tirelessly by strange[NL]
men in hoods for most of this journey.[AN]
Why, then, should I take a masked man[NL]
with no name at his word?[AN]
[MidRight]
...It's true, I've given you[NL]
no cause to trust me.[AN]
The only assurance I can offer[NL]
is that we face the same enemy.[AN]
This mask is a necessary evil--[AN]
I risk my life speaking to you[NL]
even from behind it.[AN]
I only hope that this is enough[NL]
to bend your ear to my missive.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[Beat] ...I apologize.[NL]
I will hear your message.[AN]
[MidRight]
You must reach the Temple of Mila.[AN]
The road along the Zofian coast should[NL]
give you safe passage into the valley.[AN]
If you remain on the path, you won't[NL]
be slowed by the desert sands as I was.[AN]
That desert is also the dominion of a[NL]
fearsome thief-king and kidnapper.[AN][NL]
Hear me:[.4] You mustn't cross him.[AN]
You have great courage, but I beg you--[NL]
take no unnecessary risks.[AN]
Your choices steer the fates of[NL]
more than just yourself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Thank you--[.4][AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
...He's gone?[AN]
[Right][LoadBoey]
[FarRight][LoadMae]
Talk about shady characters.[AN]
But, at least he's not[NL]
trying to kidnap you?[AN]
[Right]
That's an awfully low bar to clear.[NL]
I don't like the looks of that man.[AN]
I assure you, milady, if he puts[NL]
one foot out of line, I'll--[AN]
[MidLeft]
--It's strange, Boey.[NL]
The only reason I heard him out...[AN]
It was because something about him[NL]
reminds me of you.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
M-Me? I fail to see[NL]
the resemblance![AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadSaber]
Looks like Mr. Mask's got[NL]
some good intel, at least.[AN]
You got any guess as to[NL]
who he might be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
None.[AN]
I've no allies left in this world,[NL]
save the ones I travel with now.[AN]
[FarRight]
Oof. Didn't mean to sour the mood.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Back to the matter at hand...[AN]
The road back to the castle[NL]
is well and truly blocked off.[AN]
I suppose we've no choice but to[NL]
follow that man's directions.[AN]
[Right]
Well, it's a lucky thing we've no[NL]
need to head back there.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Now we couldn't go to aid Alm[NL]
even if we wanted to...[AN]
[Right]
...Milady?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
It's nothing. We've spent enough[NL]
time here. Let's press on.[AN]

Probably best to avoid them.[NL]

[FarRight][LoadCatria]
[Right][LoadPalla]
Oh, good! I was hoping we'd find you.[NL]
You really saved us today.[AN]
[FarRight]
I'm glad we've found a chance[NL]
to thank you properly.[AN]
We've managed to dig up some additional[NL]
information on our sister's fate.[AN]
[Right]
Turns out our sister Est is being[NL]
held by a thief named Grieth.[AN]
Your strength is beyond reproach,[NL]
that much is certain...[AN]
If you're headed to Grieth's citadel,[NL]
perhaps you'd let us join you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is a bit of a detour, but...[NL]
I can't abandon someone in such need.[AN]
We'll advance on Grieth's base[NL]
as soon as we depart.[AN]

losing both my sisters.[AN]
You must rescue Est.[NL]

So what if those guys[NL]
sprout up like weeds?[AN]
It's perfect target practice![AN]
After this little warm-up,[NL]
we can storm the Temple of Mila[AN]

To reach the Temple of Mila, cross the[NL]
valley approach and continue north.[AN]
The temple's more than just a place of[NL]
worship for the goddess, you know--[AN]
it also defends the sluice gate[NL]
at the kingdom's border.[AN]
However, the gate opens only to[NL]
members of the Zofian royal family.[AN]
With His Highness Lima IV gone,[NL]
the sluice may lie closed forever...[AN]

After losing my husband to the plague[NL]
that hit our village, I fell apart.[AN]
My son felt he had to help me.[NL]
I tried to stop him, but it was no use.[AN]
He left for the Dragon Shrine in order[NL]
to find the Well of Revival.[AN]
They said it can give life to the dead,[NL]
so he seeks to return my husband.[AN]
Though I fear I'm more like to lose[NL]
a son than reclaim a husband.[AN]
That shrine is a horror of a place.[NL]
I won't let my son die there.[AN]

I tried my hand at carving[NL]
a likeness of Duma.[AN]
Figured maybe his blessing would help[NL]
me chop through the forest, yeah?[AN]
And it WORKED![NL]
When I'm holding it,[AN]
I can feel strength surging[NL]
through my chopping arm![AN]
Though, I've noticed way more Terrors[NL]
showing up in this here valley...[AN]
D'you think I carved his image wrong?[NL]

This is dire.[.5] I'd heard tell that[NL]
the closer one gets to Mila's power,[AN]
the greater in strength and number[NL]
the Terrors that spawn are.[AN]
[MidRight]
As harsh as it is that they've[NL]
chosen to rise so close to a town,[AN]
I wouldn't say it's dire.[AN]
It means there is still hope.[NL]
Mila is still there.[.5] I can feel it.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I'd...[.5] hate to think about how[NL]
many more we'll be seeing.[AN][OpenEyes]
Not that I won't fulfill my duty[NL]
to serve and protect you, of course![AN]
[MidRight]
You don't have to put on[NL]
a brave face for me, Boey.[AN]
I know your feelings on Terrors.[AN]
The fact that you've agreed[NL]
to face them with me[AN]
is proof enough of your bravery.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]

I'm not scared of Terrors![AN]

the desert southwest of here.[AN]
There's someone we're looking to[NL]

You've gotta be either bold as hell[NL]
or dumb as a rock[AN]
to go up against THAT guy.[AN]

Lucky for you, we're both![AN][ToggleSmile]
And we've got a score to[NL]
settle with him, too.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We've got three younger brothers,[NL]
and Grieth kidnapped all of them![AN]
He raided this village while my[NL]
big bro was deployed on the frontier.[AN]
I wasn't strong enough to take[NL]
all those guys at once...[AN]
[Left]
I want to tear that thief's head[NL]
clean off his body![AN]
But the two of us alone can't do it.[AN]
If you're headed to the desert,[NL]
let us come and have our revenge.[AN]

The same ones we scared off with[NL]

Those'll be sure to bring in the gold.[NL][ToggleSmile]
Even after Grieth takes his cut...[AN]
Listen up, men![NL]

So I up and chased after her,[NL]

Turns out trying to take on a group of[NL]

Anyway, that's my story--[.5]what's yours?[AN]

We're headed to Grieth's Citadel,[NL]

Could we ask you to guide us there?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Grieth's Citadel?![NL]
Er, look.[AN]
You seem smart and capable and all,[NL]
but...[.5] I wouldn't recommend it.[AN]
His payroll's a veritable who's who[NL]
of Zofia's nastiest thugs.[AN]
And no matter how tough you are,[NL]
I don't like those odds.[AN]
[Left]
But there must be some way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hrrrrmm...[.5] Maybe ask the Deliverance?[NL]
They're nuts.[.5] They might be up for it.[AN]
They chased off Desaix, didn't they?[NL]
...Which is actually pretty impressive.[AN]
[Left]
The Deliverance force marches west to[NL]
the border to fight the Rigelian army.[AN]
[MidRight]
Do they now?[.5] Well, that's optimistic.[NL]
I guess that means you're out of luck.[AN]

Aw, c'mon.[.5] Don't give me that look![NL]
Damsel-in-distress types slay me.[AN]
Just break my heart.[AN]
I mean, not that you're a damsel[NL]
or anything, but...[AN]
Hmm...[.5] Well, I suppose there is[NL]
one thing you might try...[AN]
[Left]
And what's that?[AN]
[MidRight]
Deen and Sonya.[.5] Two of Grieth's best.[AN]
They're tough, but it's not loyalty[NL]
that keeps them in Grieth's service.[AN]
I don't know the specifics, but it's[NL]
clear they've their own ambitions.[AN]
They guard his citadel from the north[NL]
and south ends of the desert.[AN]
Break through one, and you'll have a[NL]
clear path to move on Grieth.[AN]
Whichever you fight, the other won't[NL]
go out of their way to chase you down.[AN]
...Er, probably.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hey, hold on...[AN]
[MidRight]
Like I said, going up against Grieth's[NL]
entire force at once is suicide.[AN]
But knock out Deen or Sonya and focus[NL]
on Grieth and his men at the citadel?[AN]
Well then, you might just have[NL]
yourself a chance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
And if you're wrong and they chase us[NL]
down while swearing bloody revenge?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yowza.[.5] Yeah, in that case,[NL]
I'm guessing you're probably dead.[AN]
[FarLeft]
The fact you've worked as a mercenary[NL]
this long staggers the imagination.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Aw shucks, you little flatterer![NL]
That's sweet of you to say.[AN]
Look, your ultimate goal is getting[NL]
to the Temple of Mila, right?[AN]
So this thing with Grieth is just a[NL]
bit of...[.5] what? Community service?[AN]

[MoveMidLeft]Oh, by the Mother![AN]

I'm sure the answer will come to you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No. [.4]No, that can't...[AN]

You're a priestess, aye?[AN]
Other of your kind have tried to cross[NL]
this valley and seek Mila's blessing.[AN]
But nary a one of them have completed[NL]
the journey in one piece.[AN]
Ignorance is a pitiable thing,[NL]
aye, so it is.[AN]
Doubly so when it's the very Mother[NL]
who's responsible for your suffering...[AN]

Only one of Zofia's royal bloodline[NL]
can open the temple's sluice gate.[AN]
With His Highness Lima IV deceased,[NL]
who is left to take his place?[AN]
What's more, I hear the western gate[NL]
has been occupied by Rigelian forces.[AN]
At this rate, Zofia is at risk of[NL]
a flood like we've never seen before.[AN]
Please, take this ring.[AN]

I always thought it would be[NL]
crazy beautiful, you know?[AN]
I mean, Mila can't ACTUALLY live[NL]

Princess Anthiese![AN]

Irma! Tell me what happened.[AN]
[MidRight]
I beg forgiveness, Your Highness.[AN]
I had no idea the temple fell[NL]
to the empire while I was prisoner.[AN]
They took Mila...[NL]
and Your Highness's circlet as well.[AN]
It's unthinkable. They're no knights--[NL]
only blasphemers and thieves![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
The Rigelians hold Mila captive?![NL]
You're certain of this?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am, Your Highness.[NL]
Emperor Rudolf led the charge himself.[AN]
Sealed her powers and took her away.[NL]
To where, I fear I know not.[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
Rudolf himself...[AN]

Now, hold on just a tick.[AN]
We get to the temple and[NL]
everything's taken care of.[AN]
That was the deal.[AN]

Nothing like this has[NL]

Well, I guess now we know why[NL]
the soil's gone barren.[AN]
It's been cut off from Mila's bounty.[AN]

[Beat] What do we do now, milady?[AN]
[Left][OpenEyes]
The only thing we can.[NL]
We find the Mother and bring her back.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh, please take this as[NL]
kindly as possible, milady, but...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Are you MAD?![.4] How exactly do we[NL]
"bring her back"? And from where?![AN]
[Left]
I don't know.[AN]
But if the Rigelian Army took her,[NL]
she'll be somewhere in the empire.[AN]
And since we've already[NL]
come to the border...[AN]
Well, we might as well[NL]
continue into Rigel.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold on just a moment.[NL]
You're saying we INVADE Rigel?[AN][MoveMidRight]
This isn't a motley band of[NL]
pirates or thieves--[AN]
it's an entire empire of them![AN]
We should all take a step back[NL]
and consider our opti--[AN]
[Left]
No amount of thinking will change[NL]
the situation. Come, Boey.[AN]
This isn't the first time we've[NL]
faced hopeless odds.[AN]
And when people told us to give up,[NL]
did we run?[AN]
We need to trust in our abilities.[NL]
We've come this far for a reason.[AN]
And that reason is restoring Mila[NL]

She's still the only one who can[NL]
save the world from this...chaos.[AN]

A question for another time.[AN]
Are you prepared to accept them,[NL]
Princess?[AN]
[Left]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
This is no mere memento of your mother.[AN]
It is a crown--and accepting it[NL]
is a kind of coronation.[AN]
As princess of Zofia, are you prepared[AN]
to wear this and ascend the throne?[NL]
[Left]
I[Beat] I'm afraid I know little of[NL]
kingdoms or the scope of rule.[AN]
But I have people I wish to protect.[NL]
Both here and elsewhere.[AN]
I wish for this by my will alone.[NL]
For my own happiness.[AN]
Is that resolve enough?[AN]
