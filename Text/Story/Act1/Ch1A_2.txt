Alm![.4] Over here![NL]
Come look at this![AN]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
What is it, Celica?[NL]
You find something?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
I made a wreath out of these flowers.[NL]
Here, put it on![AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Wh-what?[.4] No![AN]
[MidRight]
Why not?[.4] I think it'd make you[NL]
look very handsome.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I think you mean [0x93]very stupid.[0x94][NL]
Boys don't wear wreaths.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Don't call it stupid![NL]
It took me a long time to make this.[AN]
[Beat]Fine then.[.4] Maybe I'll just give it[NL]
to Grandpapa instead.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You're kidding, right?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Grandpapa knows a manly wreath when he[NL]
sees one[Beat] unlike SOME boys.[.4] Ha ha.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Har har.[NL]
Very funny.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You're picturing him wearing it.[NL]
Ha ha![.4] Admit it![AN]
[FarLeft]
...Heh heh.[AN]
[MidRight]
There's the smile I was looking for.[NL]
[Beat]Huh?[.4] What, is something wrong?[AN]
[FarLeft]
No, I just...[NL]
I'm glad you've cheered up, is all.[AN]
When you first came to the village,[NL]
you always looked so grouchy.[AN]
Plus, you never spoke a word![AN]
Grandpapa told me to be nice, but I[NL]
wasn't sure how to make things better.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I think you did just fine.[AN]
Each story that you told me,[NL]
each flower you picked for me,[AN]
each walk you took with me here--[NL]
that all made a difference, Alm.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Come on, I didn't do anything special.[AN]
[MidRight]
Or maybe you did.[.4] I'm sorry that[NL]
my first words to you were so unkind.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Are you talking about when you[NL]
called me a [0x93]boor[0x94], or a [0x93]clod[0x94]?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, I said I'm sorry![.4] I've just[NL]
never had any friends my age.[AN]
So I guess I wasn't used to[NL]
boys like you.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Well, I'd never met a girl like you,[NL]
either. Don't let it get to you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Say, Alm?[.4] Why are you so nice to me?[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
See this?[.4] We have the same mark.[AN]
[MidRight]
Um, yes?[.4] Except yours is on your left[NL]
hand and mine is on my right...[AN]
[Left]
Well, that makes us close![NL]
[Beat]Er, doesn't it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha ha! I suppose it does,[NL]
in a strange sort of way.[AN]
I wonder why the marks[NL]
are so similar.[AN]
[Left]
It's because they're special.[AN]
They prove that the two of us[NL]
belong together.[.4] Always.[AN]
That is, if you're not already tired[NL]
of a clod like me making you laugh.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course not![.4] So...do you mean it?[NL]
We'll always be together?[AN]
[Left]
Yes. I promise.[NL]
Isn't that what you want?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, of course![NL]
You have my word, I'll never leave.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadAlm]
[Left]
Hm? Hold, everyone.[AN]
[FarLeft]
What is it, Lukas?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadBrigand2]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidRight]
Hrmm...[AN]
[FarLeft]
More brigands?[.5] I guess the[NL]
town crier wasn't exaggerating.[AN]
[Left]
Based on their numbers, I surmise[NL]
they must have a hideout nearby.[AN]
But we can't afford to pick fights with[NL]
every cutpurse and rogue we encounter.[AN]
Let's sit back and[NL]
lay low until they depart.[AN]
[Left][Clear]
[FarLeft][Clear]
[....]
[MidRight][Clear]
[MidRight][LoadBrigand2]
[FarFarLeft][LoadJarth]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Didja get a load of that wench[NL]
we nabbed this morning? Hoo-ee![AN]
[MidRight]
She'll certainly add some color to[NL]
that run-down old shrine...[AN]
or at least, the gold we'll sell[NL]
her for will![.5][MoveMidRight] Gar har har![AN]
[MidLeft]
She's prettier'n the boss,[NL]
that's fer sure...[AN]
Too bad the king's dead.[AN]
He'd have paid the whole[NL]
treasury to get another priestess[AN]
in his royal harem![....][NL]
We'd be rich, I tell ya![AN]
[MidRight][Clear]
[MidLeft][Clear]

[FarLeft]
What in Mila's name is--?![AN]
[Left]
Alm?[.4] Let's just be calm, and...[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarFarRight]
[Left][MoveLeft]
[Left]
Alm?![.4] Alm, wait, don't--[AN]

[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Hold it, you lecherous pigs!![AN]
[Right]
Huh?[.4] Who the hell are you?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Release the prisoner[NL]
you're holding, or else!![AN]
[FarRight]
Now THAT'S rich.[.5] Or else WHAT?[AN]
[Right]
You must really want a knifin'[NL]
if yer tauntin' the likes of us.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadLukas]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
So much for laying low...[NL]
To arms, everyone![AN]

##Ch1_2_ArcherText
[MidLeft][LoadLukas]
[MidLeft]
Look over there.[NL]
They have an archer.[AN]
He can strike from a distance, so[NL]
we must plan our approach carefully.[AN]
Whoever goes after him needs to[NL]
finish him quickly,[AN]
or be ready for a reprisal.[AN]
If you're not strong enough to[NL]
take an arrow or two,[AN]
stay well away.[AN]
[Red]Careful positioning[Red] may make it[NL]
harder for arrows to land.[AN]

##Ch1_2_Postbattle
[Left][LoadLukas]
[MidRight][LoadAlm]
[Left]
Well, I suppose that counts[NL]
as our good deed for the day.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, Lukas.[.5] My legs were moving[NL]
before I had a chance to think.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Valor is nothing to be sorry for.[NL]
Now let's find this prisoner[AN]
they spoke of.[.5] They mentioned a[NL]
shrine, yes?[.5] It must be nearby.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Could it be that one[NL]
just past that hill?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadGray]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
Uh, you mean the big, obvious[NL]
stone temple over there?[AN]
[MidRight]
Temple...?[.5] Is that what that is?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Oh, right, I guess you wouldn't[NL]
know since you've been stuck in Ram.[AN]
Shrines like that were built for folks[NL]
to have a place to worship Mila.[AN]
But, with the famines and the[NL]
pestilence and all that,[AN]
it kinda put a damper on[NL]
most Zofians' piety.[AN]
Now they're mostly just[NL]
homes to brigands and the like.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then we're going there.[NL]
We have to save that prisoner![AN]

Sorry, Lukas.[.5] My legs were moving[NL]

[Left][ToggleSmile]
Valor is nothing to be sorry for.[NL]
Now let's find this prisoner[AN]
they spoke of.[.5] They mentioned a[NL]
shrine, yes? It must be nearby.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Could it be that one[NL]
just past that hill?[AN]
[Left]
That looks like as good a bet as any.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then we're going there.[NL]
We have to save that prisoner![AN]
