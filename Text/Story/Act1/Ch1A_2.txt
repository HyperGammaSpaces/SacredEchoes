Hm? Hold, everyone.[AN]
[FarLeft]
What is it, Lukas?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadBrigand2]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidRight]
Hrmm...[AN]
[FarLeft]
More brigands?[.5] I guess the[NL]
town crier wasn't exaggerating.[AN]
[Left]
Based on their numbers, I surmise[NL]
they must have a hideout nearby.[AN]
But we can't afford to pick fights with[NL]
every cutpurse and rogue we encounter.[AN]
Let's sit back and[NL]
lay low until they depart.[AN]

Didja get a load of that wench[NL]
we nabbed this morning? Hoo-ee![AN]
[MidRight]
She'll certainly add some color to[NL]
that run-down old shrine...[AN]
or at least, the gold we'll sell[NL]
her for will![.5][MoveMidRight] Gar har har![AN]
[MidLeft]
She's prettier'n the boss,[NL]
that's fer sure...[AN]
Too bad the king's dead.[AN]
He'd have paid the whole[NL]
treasury to get another priestess[AN]
in his royal harem![....][NL]
We'd be rich, I tell ya![AN]

Hold it, you lecherous pigs!![AN]

Huh?[.4] Who the hell are you?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Release the prisoner[NL]
you're holding, or else!![AN]
[FarRight]
Now THAT'S rich.[.5] Or else WHAT?[AN]
[Right]
You must really want a knifin'[NL]
if yer tauntin' the likes of us.[AN]

So much for laying low...[NL]
To arms, everyone![AN]

[MidLeft]
Look over there.[NL]
They have an archer.[AN]
He can strike from a distance, so[NL]
we must plan our approach carefully.[AN]
Whoever goes after him needs to[NL]
finish him quickly,[AN]
or be ready for a reprisal.[AN]
If you're not strong enough to[NL]
take an arrow or two,[AN]
stay well away.[AN]
[Red]Careful positioning[Red] may make it[NL]
harder for arrows to land.[AN]

Well, I suppose that counts[NL]
as our good deed for the day.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, Lukas.[.5] My legs were moving[NL]
before I had a chance to think.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Valor is nothing to be sorry for.[NL]
Now let's find this prisoner[AN]
they spoke of.[.5] They mentioned a[NL]
shrine, yes?[.5] It must be nearby.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Could it be that one[NL]
just past that hill?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadGray]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
Uh, you mean the big, obvious[NL]
stone temple over there?[AN]
[MidRight]
Temple...?[.5] Is that what that is?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Oh, right, I guess you wouldn't[NL]
know since you've been stuck in Ram.[AN]
Shrines like that were built for folks[NL]
to have a place to worship Mila.[AN]
But, with the famines and the[NL]
pestilence and all that,[AN]
it kinda put a damper on[NL]
most Zofians' piety.[AN]
Now they're mostly just[NL]
homes to brigands and the like.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then we're going there.[NL]
We have to save that prisoner![AN]
