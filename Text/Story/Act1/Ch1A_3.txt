Alm, do you see that chest?[NL]
If we had a lockpick, perhaps[AN]
we could open it.[.5] Although,[NL]
you'd best get to it before[AN]
any treasure hunters do.[AN]

I'll try, Lukas.[.5] Sir Mycen showed me[NL]
how to break open locks with my sword.[AN]

What's that boss-man thinkin', huh?[NL]
I signed up for snatching treasure,[AN]

Hmm[Beat] it'd be a good opportunity to[NL]

Sir, please allow me to[NL]
give you my thanks.[AN]
You truly helped me out of a bind.[AN]
[FarLeft]
No thanks needed.[.5] It's the least[NL]
we could do.[.5] What's your name?[AN]

I am Silque.[.5] I hail from[NL]

So, uh, Silque[Beat][....] What brings[NL]
a woman of the cloth like you[AN]
so far from home?[AN]
[MidRight]
I was on a pilgrimage through Zofia[NL]
to see a man named Sir Mycen.[AN]
I always seem to run into trouble when[NL]
I travel, though, and took shelter[NL]
in this shrine.[AN]

mark on your left hand?[AN]

Oh, this?[.4] Sure.[.4] Weird birthmark, huh?[NL]
And that's not even the weirdest part.[AN]
A long time ago I knew a girl who[NL]
had the same mark on her hand.[AN]

So you're the one sh--[AN]

Uh[Beat] Silque?[AN]

Sir Alm, providence has brought me[NL]
to this very shrine.[AN]
I have something to give to you.[NL]
Please take this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, uh, thank you.[.5] I'll be sure[NL]
my grandfather gets it.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, this is definitely for you.[NL]
This is Mila's Turnwheel.[AN]
This relic is imbued with[NL]
the Mother's power.[AN]
Let it protect you in the[NL]
coming days.[AN]

I promise to take good care of it.[NL]
By the way, how do you use this?[AN]
[MidRight]
You don't use it.[.5] It uses you.[AN]
When the time is right, this[NL]
relic will give you a sign.[AN]

I'm[Beat] not sure I get it, but[NL]

It was[Beat] It was so clear![NL]

Be calm.[.4] What you saw in the[NL]
vision is not the present.[AN]
The Mother is either telling you[NL]
what could be, or what once was.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So[Beat] so the vision is something[NL]
that's going to happen?[AN]
[MidRight]
Something that COULD happen.[NL]
If the vision was ill-boding,[AN]
perhaps it was a sign--[AN]
a sign that the Mother wishes[NL]
you to take action to prevent it.[AN]

Sir Alm.[AN]
In my travels, I have witnessed[NL]
the sorry state of our kingdom.[AN]
With no goddess to bless them[NL]
and no king to rule,[AN]
most Zofians are at a loss.[AN]
And I, for one, refuse to stand by[NL]

I would ask for permission to[NL]
accompany you on your quest.[AN]

Well, when you put it like that...[NL]
