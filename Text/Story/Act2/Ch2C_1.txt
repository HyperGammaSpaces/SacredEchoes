Milady, this graveyard we're passing[NL]
through[Beat] Er, why are we, again?[AN]
[Left]
Because it's the only way to port.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yes, but there's been talk of Terrors[NL]
around here as of late...[AN]
[Left]
So there has.[.5] Best keep our[NL]
wits about us then, hmm?[AN]
[FarLeft]
But milady, I[Beat] I'll face down thieves[NL]
or rogues any day, but Terrors?[AN]
Terrors are[Beat] different.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, Boey.[.5] How can you be so scared of[NL]
spooks and spirits at your age?[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Shove off, would you?[NL]
A man can't help what gives him fright![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh, not you too, milady?[NL]
You wound me...[AN]
[Left]
I'm sorry, Boey.[NL]
I was just remembering my brother.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Brother?[.4] I didn't realize you had one.[AN]
[Left]
Yes, though by different mothers.[NL]
He was a sweet thing, but meek.[AN]
Frightened to death of ghosts.[NL]
[CloseEyes]Then he became one, alas.[AN]
And much too young...[.5] [OpenEyes]Were he alive,[NL]
you two would have been quite alike.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Milady, I...[AN]
[MidRight]
Way to go, Boey.[AN]
Your whining's gone and dredged up[NL]
a bunch of sad memories for Celica.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What?[.4] Why is this MY fault?![AN]
[MidRight]
Uhh, because it's ALWAYS your fault![AN]
Now suck it up and get ready to[NL]
fry some foes--[.4]Terrors or otherwise![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Terrain bears no influence on magic.[NL]
I remember Sir Mycen saying so.[AN]
Listen close, friends:[.4] do not be shy[NL]
about when and where you attack![AN]
Even if our foes cower in the woods,[NL]
our spells will find their mark![AN]

##Ch2_1_CelicaRange
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
That monster may have a bow,[NL]
but I'm quick with my spells.[AN]
I can still cast a counterattack[NL]
with my sword in hand.[AN]

##Ch2_1_PostBattle
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
That should quiet their souls[NL]
for a time.[.5] For now, we must press on.[AN]
