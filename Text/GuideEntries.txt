#0x614 Guide_MagRes
Classes which can use magic,[NL]
such as mages and clerics,[NL]
will learn new spells as they[NL]
reach certain levels.[NL]
Spells which cause damage[NL]
are known as black magic,[NL]
while spells that heal or[NL]
cause other effects are called[NL]
white magic.[NL]
Spells are powerful tools both[NL]
inside and outside of combat,[NL]
but they usually cost HP to cast,[NL]
so be aware of the tradeoff.[NL]
A unit's RES stat reduces[NL]
the damage it takes from[NL]
the opponent's magic.[NL]
Additionally, the Dread Fighter[NL]
class takes halved damage[NL]
from magical attacks, making[NL]
them effective for fighting[NL]
powerful magic users.
[X]

#0x618 Guide_MovementSkills
Some classes have additional[NL]
abilities connected to movement[NL]
that they can use when near[NL]
other units. There are four[NL]
such abilities:[NL]
1. Shove[NL]
(Allows a unit to push an ally[NL]
one tile away)[NL]
2. Smite[NL]
(Allows a unit to push an ally[NL]
two tiles away)[NL]
3. Swap[NL]
(Allows a unit to trade places[NL]
with an adjacent ally)[NL]
4. Pivot[NL]
(Allows a unit to move to the[NL]
opposite side of an ally)[NL]
Shove and Smite can be used[NL]
on red or green units as well,[NL]
if the user's constitution[NL]
is higher than the target's.[NL]
Some units, such as bosses,[NL]
cannot be shoved.
[X]

#0x619 Guide_RestoringHP
Restore HP to your units by using[NL]
vulneraries and white magic.[NL]
Vulneraries and elixirs heal[NL]
only the user, while white magic[NL]
costs the user's HP to heal[NL]
a target unit. Choose your[NL]
healing method carefully.
[X]

#0x61A Guide_Status
There are four abnormal states[NL]
a unit can enter:[NL]
1. Freeze[NL]
(Paralyzed and unable to move)[NL]
2. Silence[NL]
(Unable to use any magic)[NL]
3. Poison[NL]
(Take continual damage)[NL]
4. Petrify[NL]
(Turned to stone, cannot move)[NL]
These conditions will continue for[NL]
several turns. They can be[NL]
reversed with a Restore spell.

keys and torches.
[X]

#0x627 Guide_HealTiles
Any unit that ends its turn[NL]
on a fortress, supply tile,[NL]
gate, or throne will regain[NL]
some HP automatically at the[NL]
beginning of the next turn.[NL]
Additionally, special rings[NL]
can be held to restore HP[NL]
from anywhere, and can even be[NL]
combined with the recovery[NL]
from these terrain types.
[X]

#0x62D Guide_FOW
Darkness and fog limit your[NL]
field of vision, preventing[NL]
you from seeing distant enemies.[NL]
Use thieves, torches, and[NL]
Torch spells to increase your[NL]
field of vision.
[X]

#0x63E Guide_Skirmishes
Sometimes, enemies will appear[NL]
on the world map. Moving onto[NL]
the same location as an enemy[NL]
will cause a battle to begin.[NL]
If you haven't cleared the[NL]
chapter at that location yet,[NL]
the enemy will bolster the[NL]
numbers of the opposing army[NL]
in the chapter battle, so[NL]
take them out quickly!
[X]

#0x640 Guide_EXP
Units gain EXP (experience[NL]
points) by fighting and by using[NL]
magic. They go up a level when[NL]
they earn 100 EXP. As they go[NL]
up in level, characters become[NL]
stronger, more skilled, etc.[NL]
The highest level is level 20.[NL]
The more advanced the unit's[NL]
class is, the slower it levels.
[X]

#0x641 Guide_ClassChange
Most units can change classes[NL]
once they reach a certain level.[NL]
This level varies by class, but[NL]
is indicated with an icon of[NL]
a winged Mila statue on the[NL]
unit's status screen.[NL]
When standing next to a Mila[NL]
Statue on a battle map,[NL]
the Mila option will appear[NL]
in the command menu.[NL]
Changing classes will bring[NL]
a unit's stats up to the bases[NL]
of the new class.[NL]
Villagers can choose from 5[NL]
classes to promote into,[NL]
but those and other classes[NL]
have a set promotion order,[NL]
so consider your team makeup[NL]
when choosing a branch.
[X]

#0x643 Guide_LordSwitch
After a certain point in the[NL]
story, you will be able to[NL]
control both Alm and Celica[NL]
on the world map.[NL]
To change which main character[NL]
you are moving, move the cursor[NL]
over an empty area and select[NL]
Switch from the map menu.[NL]
Alm and Celica have separate[NL]
parties and convoys, but[NL]
if you are playing on Easy,[NL]
they will be able to share items.
[X]

#0x644 Guide_Retreat

in shrines, caves, and in[NL]
story locations you have[NL]
already cleared.[NL]
