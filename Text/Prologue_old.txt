[Left]
Well done, Alm. We'll end today's[NL]
training here. Your swordsmanship[AN]
has come a long way. I've always[NL]
known you had talent.[AN]
[Right]
You really think so?[AN]
You're not just saying that,[NL]
are you, Grandfather?[AN]
[Left]
Either I'm getting old[NL]
or you're getting better--[AN]
and we both know I'm not old.[A]
[Right]
Ha! Well, good.[NL]
Then that means you're ready to[AN]
let me travel outside the village.[AN]
[Left]
Don't misconstrue my words, boy.[NL]
The rule still stands.[A]
[Right]
But why?! I'm not a child anymore.[NL]
You just said I can fend for myself![AN]
If I meet with any dangers,[NL]
I'll have my sword and my wits.[AN]
[Left]
Alm, that's not what this is about.[A]
[Right]
Then what IS it about?[A]
[Left]
Alm...[A]
[Right]
Look, I've heard from the others.[NL]
I know the drought's made Zofia[AN]
a scary place. People are starving,[NL]
and many have turned to thievery[AN]
and plunder. Brigands loot villages[NL]
for a mere sack of grain, and soon[AN]
they'll be at OUR door![A]
[Right]
And don't think I haven't heard what[NL]
the Rigelian army has been up to.[AN]
They've been crossing the border[NL]
for years in violation of[AN]
the Divine Accord. And with that[NL]
sacred bond broken, now the Terrors[AN]
have resurfaced as well...[A]
[Left]
...All true.[A]
[Right]
Zofia is full of innocent people[NL]
who are looking for help.[AN]
Please, Grandfather.[A]
[Right]
I want to make a difference in[NL]
a world bigger than a handful of houses.[AN]
I want to see all the amazing places[NL]
you've told me about--[AN]
that Celica told me about![A]
[Left]
Suppose you do set forth with[NL]
your sword and your wits. So what?[AN]
[Right]
...[A]
[Left]
Will the grand story of your life be[NL]
how you met the end of a brigand's axe?[AN]
Before you dream of changing the world,[NL]
learn your damned place in it.[AN]
And no more talk of leaving.[A]
[Clear]
[Right]
...What's his problem?![NL]
Why teach me to use a sword if[AN]
you're not going to let me fight?[A]
[Right]
Every day in this place is exactly[NL]
the same as the next.[AN]
I know I'm meant for more than this![NL]
But you have to let me find it![AN]
[Right]
Huh? What's all the commotion?[NL]
It's coming from the gates. Hmm...[AN]
