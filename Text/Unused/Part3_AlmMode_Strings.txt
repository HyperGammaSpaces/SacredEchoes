##CelicaMycen_Talk
Celica: Grandpapa!
Mycen: My dear Celica. So we meet again after all these years.
Celica: Oh, Grandpapa! I've missed you so much. 
Mycen: And I you. How you've grown! You have changed in so many leaps and bounds that I can hardly recognize you! That old man must've put as much love into training you as I did.
Celica: Hee hee. Nomah spent much time with me working on magic. But...
Mycen: Is there something that ails you?
Celica: Grandpapa, I'll be honest with you. I'm still the scared little girl that you saved all those years ago. Even though I had all that training for all of those years, I still threw everyone into danger-
Mycen: Celica, there is no one in this world that does not tremble in the face of their fears, including the most experienced of knights. But your courage to press on has stoked my trust in your guidance. And I know Nomah felt the same as he saw you off.
Celica: Oh... I didn't realize.
Mycen: You have done your best to stay strong for the sake of your friends. Thank you for your continued strength, Princess.
Celica: Um... Is it still alright to call you Grandpapa? I understand if you don't-
Mycen: I would like nothing more than that, Celica.
Celica: In that case... Thank you, Grandpapa.




## RineaSacrifice_Scene
[Berkut]
It's not possible... Alm is the emperor's true son? Which makes him the rightful successor to the imperial throne. All this time... All the effort! What has it all been for?! ...No. It isn't true. It can't be. I refuse to believe it. Nothing but lies. Lies, lies, lies, lies, LIES!
[Berkut]
Is that... an altar? How did I get here? What's happening?
[Duma]
Heed me...
[Berkut]
Who are y--
[Duma]
Heed me, you who thirst for power... Call to me. Accept me unto your soul.
[Berkut]
That voice... Duma? Is it really you?
[Duma]
...
[Berkut]
What...?
[Rinea]
Lord Berkut!
[Berkut]
Rinea...
[Rinea]
I've been looking all over for you. This is the last place I would have expected to find you. You always hated the Faithful, after all.
[Berkut]
This is true... But then I had the throne snatched from under me by some magical heir. Plying the gods' mercies is what men do in hopeless situations, is it not?
[Rinea]
I didn't mean... Forgive me. I shouldn't have said anything.
[Berkut]
...
[Rinea]
Please don't despair so. Alm seems a kind and generous man. I'm certain he'll treat you fair.
[Berkut]
And I'm to be content with that?!
[Rinea]
Ah!
[Berkut]
I wanted to BEAT him, Rinea! To dispatch him and claim the throne! I wanted to make you my empress and hold all Valentia in our palms together! But what of those dreams now...? Even Rigel alone is now forever beyond my grasp. So I'm to live in this Alm's shadow? Throw myself upon his mercy? I would sooner an honorable death at the executioner's blade!
[Rinea]
Berkut! You mustn't say such things. I never... The truth is, I never wanted to be empress.
[Berkut]
What?
[Rinea]
I think it might be nice to live a quiet life in a little villa somewhere. The crown is a terribly heavy thing... It's even... relieving, not to have to worry about it anymore. I think it was beginning to take a toll on y-- Berkut?
[Berkut]
...You too, Rinea?
[Rinea]
What?
[Berkut]
Were you laughing along with them? Rudolf, Massena, and all the rest? Watching me toil away while you knew I would never become emperor! Was every kind word part of the act? Every smile an act of PITY?!
[Rinea]
Berkut, you're frightening me!
[Berkut]
Duma! O ancient god! I call out to you now! Grant me the power to set this land to ruin for good and all! Take of me what price you will! I care not anymore!
[Rinea]
Eeek!
[Fernand]
Lord Berkut! Lord Berkut...?
[Berkut]
Is this what you desire, Lord Duma?! The blood of my betrothed?! Then I shall boil it in your name!!
[Rinea]
Berkut! Please!! It-- it burns!! Aieeeeh!
[Fernand]
Lady Rinea--!! Berkut, by all that is holy-- RELEASE HER!
[Berkut]
Power... is... all that is holy... anymore.
[Rinea]
Aieeeeeeeh!!
Ahurhgh... ggn...
.......
[Fernand]
Y-You... You heartless BEAST! I'll stop your madness here and now--
[X]

##FernandBerkut_Battle
[Fernand]
Guaagh--! M-my legs-- I can't feel--
[Berkut]
Ah... so much... power. Yes... this is enough. Heh... Heh heh ha ha ha!!

## FernandFinal_Scene_1
[Alm]
Hold up, everyone.
[Clive]
What is it, Alm?
[Alm]
Someone's... crawling? It's... Fernand?!
[Clive]
What?
[Fernand]
That voice... Clive?
[Clive]
Fernand!
[X]

## FernandFinal_Scene_2
[Clive]
Gods, what's happened to you? Don't move-- catch your breath. How long did you have to--
[Fernand]
Spare me your pity. I've none to blame for this but myself... Such trivialities matter not at this point. But you... You made it here. Then you truly intend to slay Duma?
[Clive]
We do, for it was Emperor Rudolf's dying request.
[Fernand]
I see... Then he must have known of Duma's madness.
[Clive]
Duma is mad?
[Fernand]
Oh yes... Duma is a god no longer. Merely an incarnation of the lust for power... ...You there. Alm.
[Alm]
Yeah, that's me.
[Fernand]
Listen well... You must beware of Berkut. He... He's no longer... ...Hngh!
[Alm]
Fernand!
[Fernand]
Please, Alm... Stop Duma. I know I've no right to...ask anything of you... But I beg it of you regardless... You're the only one who can end this. Let no one else be tainted by his madness. Let this tragedy end.
[Alm]
I will. I swear I will lay Duma to rest.
[Fernand]
Then I leave it...to you... Ngh!
[Clive]
Fernand! Don't move. Deep breaths. I'm with you.
[Fernand]
Haah...ha ha... Strange, isn't it...? Me, begging boons of you...
[Clive]
Not in the least. We swore an oath--no matter what comes, you are as my own brother. I'd ride to your aid from the ends of the earth.
[Fernand]
You always were...too nice for your own good. Always so...quick to pardon me... Along the way, I...I forgot how to ask you for forgiveness...
[Clive]
Fernand, please--
[Fernand]
I knew. I always knew. None of my misfortunes were anyone else's fault... Not Alm's, not Mathilda's, certainly not yours. It's mine... and no one else's. 
In the bleak winter of my family's demise, I looked to you as my sole source of warmth. I latched onto you and wanted you all to myself. You were the world to me, and I... I couldn't bear that I wasn't your whole world as well. I took anger better aimed at myself and turned it on...the defenseless masses. And I took you not doing the same on my behalf as a betrayal. I'm... sorry, Clive. I've failed my duty as a nobleman...
[Clive]
Enough, Fernand. You've suffered enough. You needn't flog yourself any further. 
[Fernand]
Good... I am... tired, dear Clive. Tired of despair... Tired of rage... But I'm... so glad I got to see you one last time. You were right... You chose the right king. I've always felt such pride... that a man of your caliber called me his friend... 
[Clive]
I... I'm here, Fernand. Stay with me. Please.
[Fernand]
Know that, however clouded my heart became, I... I loved you to the very end. I could ask for no more blissful a way to breathe my last... than in the arms of my beloved. Thank you... Clive. ......
[Clive]
...Fernand? Fernand, no. Don't do this to me. Open your eyes, Fernand! ...Fernand!
[Clair]
I simply won't accept this, Fernand! I insist you wake up this instant! We're all returning to Zofia together! ...Fernand? Fernand, say something!
[Clive]
He's gone, Clair. ...He's gone.
[Clair]
No... Oh, Fernand...
[Alm]
Are you two going to be all right?
[Clive]
...Yes. Grief will have its day, but it will not be this one. Right now, let us do what we must. Lead the way, Alm.
[Alm]
All right. Fernand... I wish I could have fought beside you in the army you created. At least now your fight is over. ...Farewell.
[X]


## BerkutFinal_Scene
[Berkut]
Nnngh...
[Alm]
Why, Berkut? To have finally found family after all this time... Why did it come to this?!
[Berkut]
Heh... I have no family...nor do I want for one. Now stop talking and finish this. End me, and you can stand alone as inheritor of Rigel's royal blood.
[Alm]
I never wanted that! Don't you get it? I've spent enough of my life alone!
[Berkut]
...The fate of a great man... is to have no one he might call a friend. Power is... the loneliest of burdens. I grow... weary of carrying it. Now... take it from me.
[Alm]
I'll carry it WITH you! It doesn't have to be this way, Berkut! We can put this all behind us and move on-- together-- You have to live. You HAVE to--
[Berkut]
So you see fit even to take away my chance... to die at the hand of an honorable warrior. Must I do everything... by myself? Ghrgh--!!
[Alm]
Berkut, no! Please!! I don't want to be alone again! Help me rebuild Rigel! Tell me about my father!
[Berkut]
You're not...a child anymore... Alm... You must...make Valentia a land not... of gods...but of men... A world where people...never again... are corrupted by divine power... You can do it... without me. I know... you...
[Alm]
Berkut! Berkut... Why? Someone please tell me... I never got to know you... or my father...
