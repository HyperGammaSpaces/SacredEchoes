[MidRight]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Something doesn't feel right[NL]
about these [OpenEyes]seas.[AN]
[Left]
Are you still worried about that[NL]
creepy blue guy on the last boat?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've only ever heard of people turning[NL]
blue like that from Duma's influence.[AN]
But why would Duma Faithful[NL]
be here, so far from Rigel?[AN]
[Left]
That cantor guy said something about[NL]
[0x93]cleaning out pirate scum[0x94]...[AN]
It's weird that Rigelians would[NL]
be worried about that kind of thing[AN]
in Zofian waters.[AN]
[FarLeft]
There's no way they'd know[NL]
your secret, right?[AN]
They would've come to the priory[NL]
if they did...[AN]

be going, lassie.[AN]

No one kills the Pirate King[NL]
and gets away with it![AN]

[FarRight][LoadValbar]
You got a score to settle, eh?[AN]
Well, it just so happens that[NL]
I've got one, too.[AN]
And if there's one thing I'm good at,[NL]
it's crackin' pirate skulls![AN]

[Right][LoadSorcerer]
How convenient...[NL]
You![.4] Pirates![AN]
Plunder the bodyguards as you please,[NL]
but leave the girl untouched.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadJarth]
Yar...[.4] I've a bone to pick with her,[NL]
meself.[.5] What's in it fer me?[AN]
[Right]
You will be well rewarded by Lord Duma's[NL]
blessings of wealth and power...[AN]
The treasure on our ship will[NL]
be all yours to keep.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That do be tempting...[AN]
[X]

##Ch2_6_Reinforcements2
[MidRight][LoadCelica]
A witch?![NL]
Everyone, watch out--[AN]
A witch's sacrifice to Duma gives her[NL]
unmatched magical power and speed...[AN]
Slower units, fall back and[NL]
stay out of her range![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadSaber]
[MidRight][LoadCelica]
Phew...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Zofia Harbor is dead ahead,[NL]
and the horizon looks clear of ships.[AN]
Personally, I can't wait to get some[NL]
land under my feet and ale in my hand.[AN]
[MidRight]
We'll be there soon.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you, Saber.[NL]
I think you've well earned it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You sure better be[NL]
payin' the tab, lass.[AN][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadBoey][ToggleSmile]
We can't rest yet, milady.[AN]
Did you hear what that sorcerer[NL]
was saying to that pirate?[AN]
He offered their entire haul[NL]
in exchange for capturing you.[AN]
[MidRight]
...This is concerning.[AN]
Where could they have found out that[NL]
I'm not just an ordinary priestess?[AN]
What do they need me,[NL]
specifically, for?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Well, assuming they know[NL]
you're the princess...[AN]
[MidRight]
What would Rigel care for that?[AN]
King Lima is dead.[.5] His bloodline[NL]
means nothing to Chancellor Desaix.[AN]
If they mean to use me as a hostage,[NL]
that ship has sailed, so to speak.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Milady, this is no time for jokes![AN]
[MidRight]
Right...[.4] Sorry, Boey.[NL]
I knew this journey wouldn't be easy.[AN]
All I ask is that we keep our sights[NL]
on finding the Goddess.[AN]
