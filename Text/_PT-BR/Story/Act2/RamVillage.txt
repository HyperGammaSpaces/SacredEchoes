How I've missed Ram Village...[NL]
Now that I'm on the mainland,[AN]
I should take a detour and see[NL]
if Grandpapa is still about.[AN]

[MoveMidRight]Mycen? [ToggleSmile]Grandpapa, it's me![NL][ToggleSmile]

...Huh?[.4] [ToggleSmile]Oh, Celica![NL]
You're back![AN][MoveMidLeft]
Gosh, how long has it been?[NL]
I've missed you so much![AN]
[MidRight]
It's good to see you again, Faye![NL]
I missed you too.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The boys all left Ram.[NL]
Did you know that?[AN]
Just up and LEFT![NL]
I'm so desperately lonely...[AN]
I thought about going after them[NL]
just to teach them a lesson,[AN]
but I thought better of[NL]
just going off alone.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Hey, wait...[.4] Are you on a journey[NL]
or a quest or whatever?[AN]
Then maybe I could go with you![AN]
[MidRight]
Of course.[NL]
We'd be glad to have you.[AN]

Celica?[.4] [MoveMidLeft]Celica, is that you?[NL]
How long has it been?![AN]
I can't believe you[NL]
came back to the village![AN]
[MidRight]
Kliff! It's certainly been a while,[NL]
hasn't it?[AN]
Have you seen Alm recently?[NL]
How about Gray and Tobin?[ToggleSmile][AN]
[MidLeft]
Alm and the others are gone,[NL]
I'm afraid.[.4] It's...[.4] a long story.[AN]
Oh, and Sir Mycen vanished[NL]
around the same time.[AN]
Ram Village was never really exciting,[NL]
but now it's unbearably dull.[AN][ToggleSmile]
So where are you off to, hmm?[NL]
Somewhere grand, no doubt.[AN]
Say, why don't you let me come along?[NL]
I bet we could both use the company.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course.[NL]
We'd be glad to have you.[AN]
