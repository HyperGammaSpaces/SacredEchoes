Wolff, sir![.5] We've spotted a[NL]
suspicious group approaching![AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm.[.5] What's their composition?[AN]
[MidRight]
Mostly light infantry,[NL]
but there are pegasi, sir.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Pegasi, eh?[.5] Quite a rare sight.[AN]
The same ones we scared off with[NL]
our arrows before, likely.[AN]
Those'll be sure to bring in the gold.[NL][ToggleSmile]
Even after Grieth takes his cut...[AN]
Listen up, men![NL]
You take care of their little friends.[AN]
I'll shoot the riders right off those[NL]
beasts with my superior aim.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Yes, sir![AN][ClearFace]
[.5][ToggleSmile][MidLeft]
You may have done well securing[NL]
yourself ONE pegasus, Grieth,[AN]
but two will make me a fortune[NL]
to rival yours.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadJesse]
Well then![AN]
Gotta say, that's the least fun I've had[NL]
getting out of a pair of handcuffs.[AN]
I guess I'll just have to try my luck[NL]
at the OTHER giant desert fortress.[AN]
But, while I'm here...[NL]
if I can't free any other prisoners,[AN]
I might as well free some of[NL]
these ill-gotten treasures.[AN]

## Ch3_3C_RecruitJesse
[MidLeft][LoadJesse]
[MidRight][LoadCelica][MoveMidRight]
You there! Yes, you with the keys![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Whoooa, HEY there, beautiful.[AN]
[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
This is not the time.[AN][OpenEyes]
You don't look like one of Grieth's[NL]
cronies.[.5] What brought you here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
So I spotted this girl at the port[NL]
of Zofia.[.5] Real cute, ya know?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Anyway, then I hear she's about to[NL]
get sold off as a slave![AN]
You believe that?[AN]
Well, I don't let ladies get sold[NL]
into slavery on my watch![.5] No sir![AN]
So I up and chased after her,[NL]
and wound up getting caught.[AN]
Turns out trying to take on a group of[NL]
slavers all alone is a terrible idea.[AN]
Anyway, that's my story--[.5]what's yours?[AN]
[MidRight]
How fortunate...[.5] We were looking for[NL]
a lead on a girl last seen there.[AN]
If you can help us find and free her,[NL]
we'd be glad to have you.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, then I'm your man![NL]
Name's Jesse, by the by.[AN]
I'm just your average[NL]
garden-variety rogue.[AN]
Normally I'd charge for my[NL]
services, but...[.5] Well,[AN]
when it's for the good of womankind,[NL]
I go pro bono if you know what I mean.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
W-Wait![.5] Y-You're still hiring me, right?![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadWolff]
You don't look half[NL]
as scared as you ought.[AN]
Don't you value your lives?[AN]
It's time you had the fear[NL]
of death put back into you![AN]

No...[AN][CloseEyes]

[MidRight][LoadJesse]
[FarLeft][LoadBoey]
[Left][LoadCelica]
Jesse, you're familiar with[NL]
this area, are you not?[AN]
We're headed to Grieth's Citadel,[NL]
and the way seems perilous.[AN]
Could we ask you to guide us there?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Grieth's Citadel?![NL]
Er, look.[AN]
You seem smart and capable and all,[NL]
but...[.5] I wouldn't recommend it.[AN]
His payroll's a veritable who's who[NL]
of Zofia's nastiest thugs.[AN]
And no matter how tough you are,[NL]
I don't like those odds.[AN]
[Left]
But there must be some way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hrrrrmm...[.5] Maybe ask the Deliverance?[NL]
They're nuts.[.5] They might be up for it.[AN]
They chased off Desaix, didn't they?[NL]
...Which is actually pretty impressive.[AN]
[Left]
The Deliverance force marches west to[NL]
the border to fight the Rigelian army.[AN]
[MidRight]
Do they now?[.5] Well, that's optimistic.[NL]
I guess that means you're out of luck.[AN]
[Left]
Sigh...[AN]
[MidRight]
Aw, c'mon.[.5] Don't give me that look![NL]
Damsel-in-distress types slay me.[AN]
Just break my heart.[AN]
I mean, not that you're a damsel[NL]
or anything, but...[AN]
Hmm...[.5] Well, I suppose there is[NL]
one thing you might try...[AN]
[Left]
And what's that?[AN]
[MidRight]
Deen and Sonya.[.5] Two of Grieth's best.[AN]
They're tough, but it's not loyalty[NL]
that keeps them in Grieth's service.[AN]
I don't know the specifics, but it's[NL]
clear they've their own ambitions.[AN]
They guard his citadel from the north[NL]
and south ends of the desert.[AN]
Break through one, and you'll have a[NL]
clear path to move on Grieth.[AN]
Whichever you fight, the other won't[NL]
go out of their way to chase you down.[AN]
...Er, probably.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hey, hold on...[AN]
[MidRight]
Like I said, going up against Grieth's[NL]
entire force at once is suicide.[AN]
But knock out Deen or Sonya and focus[NL]
on Grieth and his men at the citadel?[AN]
Well then, you might just have[NL]
yourself a chance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
And if you're wrong and they chase us[NL]
down while swearing bloody revenge?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yowza.[.5] Yeah, in that case,[NL]
I'm guessing you're probably dead.[AN]
[FarLeft]
The fact you've worked as a mercenary[NL]
this long staggers the imagination.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Aw shucks, you little flatterer![NL]
That's sweet of you to say.[AN]
Look, your ultimate goal is getting[NL]
to the Temple of Mila, right?[AN]
So this thing with Grieth is just a[NL]
bit of...[.5] what? Community service?[AN]
That's admirable, but think long[NL]
and hard before you make the trip.[AN]
[Left]
I see...[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_3C_EndingText_NoJesse
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Let's free these prisoners.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadMoneyman]
[Right][LoadYoungwoman]
Grieth didn't become king of thieves[NL]
by being a fool.[.5] He's a shrewd one.[AN]
He's been sending Desaix bribes[NL]
to escape justice for his deeds.[AN]
And his men are no better.[AN]
The pirate Barth was one such,[NL]
in fact.[AN]
I hear there are still captives[NL]
rotting away in his dungeons.[AN]
Some have been there for years,[NL]
poor souls...[AN]
If there's any way[NL]
you can help them...[AN]
[FarRight]
You'd be staring down some of[NL]
Grieth's finest if you did.[AN]
I've only hearsay to go on,[NL]
but it may be valuable enough.[AN]
Deen and Sonya are feared for their[NL]
strength, even among Grieth's men.[AN]
They're tough, but it's not loyalty[NL]
that keeps them in Grieth's service.[AN]
I don't know the specifics, but it's[NL]
clear they've their own ambitions.[AN]
They guard his citadel from the north[NL]
and south ends of the desert.[AN]
Break through one, and you'll have a[NL]
clear path to move on Grieth.[AN]
Whichever you fight, the other won't[NL]
go out of their way to chase you down.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see...[NL]
Let me think on this for a spell.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadJesse]
[MidLeft]
Going south to challenge Sonya seems[NL]
to be the wisest course of action.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sonya's said to be a deadly mage.[AN][ToggleSmile]
And, if the rumors are true, she's[NL]
as smokin' hot as her Fire spell.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But the real killer is that Excalibur[NL]
spell she's got. Better be careful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Regardless of the risk, it's the only[NL]
way we can free Grieth's prisoners.[AN]
We move out at daybreak.[NL]
Ready your weapons, everyone![AN]

originally...[AN]

Going north to challenge Deen seems[NL]
to be the wisest course of action.[AN]
[MidRight]
Deen's a loner, so I don't know much[NL]
beyond his raw battle prowess.[AN]
They say he's a former army captain[NL]
and a master of high-speed swordplay.[AN]
You sure you can handle that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Regardless of the risk, it's the only[NL]
way we can free Grieth's prisoners.[AN]

Going north to challenge Deen seems[NL]
to be the wisest course of action.[AN]
[FarRight]
Deen is a flinty loner of a man,[NL]
but a master of swordplay.[AN]
He's said to be a former army captain;[NL]
his skills are as honed as his blade.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Regardless of the risk, it's the only[NL]

Kinda bad, like.[AN]
[MidRight]
...WELL?![.5][NL]
Don't just stand there, idiot![AN]
Spit it out![AN]
[MidLeft]
The desert stronghold's[NL]
been...[.5]taken.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
WHAAAAT?![.4] Was it the Deliverance?[NL]
It was, wasn't it?[AN]
Those lousy,[.4] no-good,[.4] dung-eatin'--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Actually, it was a girl[NL]
and her friends.[AN]
Some kinda priestess or somethin'?[NL]
Kind of an odd mix if ya ask me.[AN]
A mercenary, couple'a kid mages--[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
KIDS?! You're tellin' me that Wolff[NL]
lost to a girl and some CHILDREN?![AN]
Who is she? [MoveMidRight]I need information.[NL]
All of it. [MoveMidRight]GIMME [MoveMidRight]THE [MoveMidRight]GOODS![AN]
[MidLeft]
I,[.5] I got nothin', boss, I'm sorry.[NL]
All I know is what I told ya.[AN]
Kid's a priestess, yeah?[AN]
...Oh, and she had a mark[NL]
on her right hand.[AN]
Er, so whatta we do now, boss?[AN]
Our men are sayin' she's[NL]
coming here next![AN][MoveMidLeft]
She's gonna come here and kill--[AN]
[MidRight]
Shut up for a second.[AN]
Did you say she has a mark[NL]
on her right hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-yeah, boss.[NL]
That's right.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'll be dipped in hog fat...[AN]
That's the lass Desaix[NL]
was searchin' for![AN]
That mark is proof a member of the[NL]
Zofian royal family is still alive![AN]
And you say she's headed here now?[NL][ToggleSmile]
...Heh.[.5][MoveMidRight] Haw! [MoveMidRight]BWAAAAA [MoveMidRight]ha [.4][MoveMidRight]ha [.4][MoveMidRight]ha [.5][MoveMidRight]ha![AN]
Looks like lady luck finally decided[NL]
to let me take her to the barn dance![AN]
Working with Desaix was good business[NL]
for a while, but he's finished now.[AN]
But if I serve that girl up to Rigel[NL]
on a silver platter...[AN]
then even if they take over all Zofia,[NL]
we'll still be sittin' pretty.[AN][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow]

Did you need something?[AN]

We're expectin' guests.[AN]
Some little girl and her[NL]
merry band of friends.[AN]
Deen, set up in the northern desert.[NL]
Sonya, you take the south.[AN]
I want the girl alive.[NL]
As for the rest...[AN]
Well, have some fun.[.5] You earned it.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]...YA GOT IT?![AN]
[FarLeft]
You don't need to shout, sir.[.5] There's[NL]
nothing wrong with my hearing.[AN]
If there's nothing else,[NL]
I'll be going.[AN][ClearFace]
[Left]
Understood.[.5] I'm off as well.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Bah! Impudent louts.[NL]
Still, I s'pose they get the job done.[AN]
And once they do,[ToggleSmile] I'll have a[NL]
Zofian princess in my collection.[AN]
Heh heh... [MoveMidRight]Ha ha ha![NL]
