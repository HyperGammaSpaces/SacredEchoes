That's[Beat] the Rigelian Army![AN]
Has the temple already fallen[NL]
to the Rigelians?[AN]
[MidRight]
What have they done to the Mother?[NL]
You don't think...[AN]
[MidLeft]
We need to confirm her safety[NL]
immediately.[AN]
Everyone, infiltrate the temple[NL]
as quickly as possible![AN]

Heh heh heh...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Who are you?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am Mikhail, cantor[NL]
of the Duma Faithful.[AN]
I have come to teach Duma's greatness[NL]
to the fools who cling to Mila's lies.[AN]
Now, rue your ignorance from inside[NL]
the bellies of my gargoyles![AN]
[FarLeft]
...Take care, everyone. He's a cantor--[AN]
he's likely to summon forth some[NL]
manner of terrible beast.[AN]
Stick close and watch each other's[NL]
backs above all else.[AN]

Ah, Celica![NL]
I'm glad to see you safe, child.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Nomah? What in the world[NL]
are you doing here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not to put too fine a point on it,[NL]
but I was worried about you.[AN]
I followed you as far as this temple,[NL]
but this place is just so LARGE![AN]
I'm embarrassed to say I got a bit[NL]
lost, little one. Heh heh heh![AN][ToggleSmile]
But, I see we've some troublemakers[NL]
to clear out of the Mother's house.[AN][ToggleSmile]
These kind priestesses helped lead me[NL]
to the altar to aid in the effort.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Oh, dear.[.4] Well, I'm glad to see you[NL]
in good spirits nonetheless.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps we'd both enjoy more peace[NL]
of mind if we stayed together.[AN]
Might I travel with you from here on?[AN]
[FarRight]
We could really use your help[NL]
right now, Nomah.[.4] Please do.[AN]

We've won. [Beat]Somehow.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, but look at the temple.[NL]
It's in shambles![AN]
I always thought it would be[NL]
crazy beautiful, you know?[AN]
I mean, Mila can't ACTUALLY live[NL]
in a place like this, right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know.[NL]
Let's go see for ourselves.[AN]
We must discover exactly what[NL]
came to pass in this place.[AN]

...There ain't no one here.[AN]
Where's this Earth Mother[NL]
of yours hiding, lass?[AN]
[Left]
[CloseEyes]I don't understand...[NL][OpenEyes]
Why isn't she here?[AN][MoveLeft]
She's supposed to be here![AN]
[MidRight][LoadIrma]
Princess Anthiese![AN]
[Left]
Irma! Tell me what happened.[AN]
[MidRight]
I beg forgiveness, Your Highness.[AN]
I had no idea the temple fell[NL]
to the empire while I was prisoner.[AN][NL]
They took Mila.[AN]
It's unthinkable. They're no knights--[NL]
only blasphemers and thieves![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
The Rigelians hold Mila captive?![NL]
You're certain of this?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am, Your Highness.[NL]
Emperor Rudolf led the charge himself.[AN]
Sealed her powers and took her away.[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
Rudolf himself...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Now, hold on just a tick.[AN]
We get to the temple and[NL]
everything's taken care of.[AN]
That was the deal.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadBoey]
Unfortunately, none of us expected[NL]
the Mother to have stepped out.[AN]
Nothing like this has[NL]
ever happened before.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadMae]
Well, I guess now we know why[NL]
the soil's gone barren.[AN]
It's been cut off from Mila's bounty.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] What do we do now, milady?[AN]
[Left][OpenEyes]
The only thing we can.[NL]
We find the Mother and bring her back.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh, please take this as[NL]
kindly as possible, milady, but...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Are you MAD?![.4] How exactly do we[NL]
[0x93]bring her back[0x94]? And from where?![AN]
[Left]
I don't know.[AN]
But if the Rigelian Army took her,[NL]
she'll be somewhere in the empire.[AN]
And since we've already[NL]
come to the border...[AN]
Well, we might as well[NL]
continue into Rigel.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold on just a moment.[NL]
You're saying we INVADE Rigel?[AN][MoveMidRight]
This isn't a motley band of[NL]
pirates or thieves--[AN]
it's an entire empire of them![AN]
We should all take a step back[NL]
and consider our opti--[AN]
[Left]
No amount of thinking will change[NL]
the situation. Come, Boey.[AN]
This isn't the first time we've[NL]
faced hopeless odds.[AN]
And when people told us to give up,[NL]
did we run?[AN]
We need to trust in our abilities.[NL]
We've come this far for a reason.[AN]
And that reason is restoring Mila[NL]
to her rightful place.[AN]
She's still the only one who can[NL]
save the world from this...chaos.[AN]

Hmm?[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadIrma]
Sir Knight![.4] You should be resting.[NL]
You mustn't strain your injuries.[AN]
[FarRight]
I... cannot miss this moment, Sister[NL]
Irma. With this, my mission ends.[AN]
Whether I pass or live to see tomorrow's[NL]
light, I will know I did what I could.[AN]

What mission?[.4] What is going on?[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
[Left]
Well?[.4] Go on.[NL]
Please don't leave us in suspense.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight]
Mila cannot save this world.[NL]
But you can[Beat] Princess Anthiese.[AN]
[Left]
Ah![.4] How did you--[AN]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
...This knight aided me on my[NL]
journey back to the temple.[.4] He is--[AN]
[FarRight]
--but a humble servant, Your Highness.[AN]
A servant who cannot rest until[NL]
the rightful heir is crowned.[AN][MoveFarRight]
I... guh-- I bend the knee.[NL]
Please, Sister Irma, do the honors.[AN][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadIrma]
...Right. I shall honor[NL]
Lady Liprica's dying wish.[AN]
I bear the royal circlet[NL]
and Liprica's blade.[AN]
Are you prepared to[NL]
accept them, Princess?[AN]
[Left]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
This is no mere memento of your mother.[AN]
It is a crown--and accepting it[NL]
is a kind of coronation.[AN]
As princess of Zofia, are you prepared[NL]
to wear this and ascend the throne?[AN]
[Left]
I[Beat] I'm afraid I know little of[NL]
kingdoms or the scope of rule.[AN]
I thought my life would be better spent[NL]
serving my people as a priestess[AN]
than being served as their princess.[AN]
But I have people I wish to protect.[NL]
Both here and elsewhere.[AN]
If I may use the power of the crown[NL]
to serve and protect, I shall do so.[AN]
I wish for this by my will alone.[NL]
For my own happiness.[AN]
Is that resolve enough?[AN]
[MidRight]
It is indeed. [ToggleSmile]Princess Anthiese.[AN]
By the authority the Mother has vested[NL]
in me, this crown is now yours to bear.[AN]
[Left]
I accept it willingly.[AN]

Though, from this day on,[NL]
I will no longer conceal my identity.[AN]
I expect that will bring even more[NL]
hardship than we've faced till now.[AN]
But I hope I can still[NL]
count on you all.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yeah, all right. Guess I'll go along[NL]

Or should I say [0x93]Princess Anthiese.[0x94][AN]
Anyway, our loyalty belongs to you,[NL]

Thank you all. [.4]Truly.[AN]

Please, Princess Anthiese... You[NL]
must return Mila to her throne here.[AN]
You have the power. I will stay and[NL]
ensure she has a home to return to.[AN]
[Left]
Do you know where she's been taken?[AN]
[MidRight]
I fear they've taken her deep into[NL]
the Empire, to the tower of Duma.[AN]
The usurper-priest Jedah has made[NL]
his foul nest there.[AN]

Then that's where we must go.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadConrad]
If you're headed into Rigel, please[NL]

But, your injuries...[NL]

The priestesses here will take much[NL]
better care of you than we could.[AN]
[FarRight]
I vow I shall be no burden to you.[NL]
I know well the lands of this area.[AN]
Allow me at least to guide you[NL]
to the Sage's Hamlet. A wise man[AN]
called Halcyon resides there.[AN]
I was in his care for many years,[NL]
and he will mostlike aid you as well.[AN]

...I do owe you my thanks for[NL]
protecting my mother's friend.[AN]
If this is the favor you ask,[NL]
then I shall grant it.[AN][ToggleSmile]

your full focus towards recovering.[AN]
All right?[AN]

You have my word, Your Highness.[AN]

Surprisingly enough, I think I'm[NL]
starting to get used to him.[AN]

He's not a bad sort--and he clearly[NL]
cares about my well-being.[AN]
I can't really ask for more[NL]
in such times. And yet,[AN]
he's not without his mystery...[AN]
I get a strange sense of nostalgia when[NL]
I'm near him, though I've no clue why.[AN]
