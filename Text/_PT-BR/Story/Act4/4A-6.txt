I don't believe it... That last quake cleared out some of the rocks--the road's passable again.
[MidRight]
Goodness! What a stroke of serendipity. Come now, Alm. Let's hurry across before the next tremor hits.
[MidLeft]
Right...[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm? Is something the matter?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It feels strange, is all. A little TOO convenient. It's almost like I can feel someone's intent behind it.
[MidRight]
An intentional rockslide? Really, Alm, you worry too much. Now chop chop! One mustn't dawdle. I'll await you on the far side.
[MidLeft]
[Beat] ...I don't like this at all.[NL]
I hope you're all right, Celica...[AN]

Lord Duma![AN]
Every morning and every night, I[NL]
have come to pray at this altar.[AN]
Each day I bring a greater offering...[AN] 
But I have not heard your voice[NL]
since the battle at the border.[AN]
Are my prayers reaching you?[NL]
What is it that I lack?[AN][CloseEyes]
I am a man of Rigel, noble by birth[NL]
and tested in battle.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
Every flaw and shortcoming has[NL]
been beaten out of me by force.[AN][OpenEyes]
I have suffered countless abuses in[NL]
the pursuit of power and perfection.[AN]
I have renounced my heathen ways[NL]
and sworn my soul to you.[AN]
What more, then, must I give to you?[NL]
What more do I even have to give?![AN][NL][.6][MoveMidLeft]
ANSWER ME, LORD DUMAAAA!!![AN]
