Jerome, sir?[.4] My report.[AN]
The Deliverance forces will[NL]
reach these plains momentarily.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph.[.4] So the peasants made it[NL]
here after all.[.4][MoveMidLeft] Bring me Ezekiel![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadZeke]
I'm here, sir.[NL]
You have need of me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
The Zofian rabble will be upon us in[NL]
due time. Prepare to intercept them.[AN]
...And mind your allegiances wisely.[NL]
If I smell even a whiff of betrayal,[AN]
you know what will happen.[AN]

[Beat]Could it be?[.4] I thought[NL]
I heard Tatiana's voice...[AN]

Make no unnecessary advance.[AN]
There is something I must confirm.[AN]

See? It's just like I told you![AN]
Zeke won't hurt a hair on your heads[NL]

Tatiana? But how?![AN]

It means you don't have to heed[NL]
another word Jerome says![AN]

Men! Set your sights on the target![NL]

You must be General Ezekiel.[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you know my name?[AN]
[MidRight]
Tatiana told me about you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You know Tatiana as well?[AN]
[MidRight]
We rescued her from Nuibaba.[AN]
You should have no further cause[NL]
to follow Jerome's orders.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am reluctant to trust in these times.[NL]
Yet, how else would you know all this?[AN]
You have my thanks for saving her.[AN]
Allow me to show my appreciation[NL]
in deed as well as word.[.4][MoveMidLeft] Men![AN]

You dare?![.4] I didn't think you[NL]
fool enough to betray me, Ezekiel.[AN]
You know what fate awaits[NL]
the girl now that--[AN]
[MidRight]
She's free.[.4] And now so am I.[AN]
You've ground the people here[NL]
under heel and threatened my love.[AN][MoveMidRight]

You must be Alm.[.4] Let me thank you[NL]
again for helping Tatiana.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We're happy to help, General.[AN]
I heard you were opposed to this war.[NL]
Will you lend us your strength?[AN]
Not a man among us wishes this conflict[NL]
to last any longer than it must.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Now that I have turned my lance[NL]
on Jerome, Rigel will not have me.[AN]
But neither can I offer that lance[NL]
to you. I still have no recollection[AN]
of who I am or from whence I came.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You've lost your memory?[AN]
[MidRight]
All I know is that I washed up on the[NL]
shores of Rigel grievously wounded.[AN]
I was thrown in prison and accused[NL]
of being a spy or worse.[AN]
But Emperor Rudolf saved me.[AN]
He gave me a name and took me in.[NL]
He treated me as if I were his own son.[AN][CloseEyes]
And yes, I may have betrayed him...[NL][.5][OpenEyes]
But never would I help you do him harm.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I didn't know.[.4] I'm sorry.[NL]
Forgive me for asking so much of you.[AN]
[MidRight]
You are not in the wrong.[LoadOverworldFaces][.6][NL][MoveMidRight]
...Alm! By the gods![AN]

mark on your left hand?[A]

What, this?[AN]
I don't know, actually.[NL]
I've just always had it.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
[MidRight][LoadZeke]
Is that so?[AN]
Some time ago, Emperor Rudolf gave[NL]
me what I thought was odd advice.[AN]
He said that if I met a man[NL]
with a mark on his left hand,[AN]
I was to follow him.[AN]
[0x93]For that man is chosen,[0x94] he said.[NL]
[0x93]He shall save all of Rigel.[0x94][AN]
[0x93]And with it, all of Valentia.[0x94][AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] very strange.[AN]
[MidRight]
I agree.[.4] But now that I have met you,[NL]
I must heed my emperor's words.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I am yours to command, my lord.[AN]

What's wrong, Alm?[.4] You get some[NL]
bad pottage in the mess tent again?[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Hmm? Oh[Beat] To tell you the truth,[AN]
Zeke's speech back there's been[NL]
weighing on me all afternoon.[AN]
[MidRight]
Aw, c'mon, Alm.[.4] You don't actually[NL]
BELIEVE what he said, do you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[.4] No.[.4] It just...[NL]
I don't know. Maybe a little.[AN]
If it's true, it's a lot to rest[NL]
on one person's shoulders.[AN]
Saving a whole continent, and all.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Pffft.[.4] Yeah, no pressure or anything.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But it also makes me feel[NL]
incredibly[Beat] small, in a way.[AN]
Am I really just acting out a role[NL]
in some cosmic play for the gods,[AN]
with the script set in stone[NL]
before I was even born?[AN]
Did I ever really have a choice[NL]
in what course my life would take?[AN]
[MidRight]
You?[.4] Small?[.4][MoveMidRight] Buddy, how d'you[NL]
think the REST of us feel?![AN]
What are we, a bunch of pissants?[AN]
Don't tell me you were thinking you[NL]
could take on big bad Emperor Rudolf[AN]
all by your lonesome.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I-[.4]I didn't mean it like that![AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah?[.4] So then what's the mark on[NL]
your hand got to do with anything?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
You've got the whole Deliverance[NL]
behind you, [ToggleSmile]not to mention[AN]
your best buddy Gray.[AN]
Nobody thought a bunch of ragtag[NL]
Zofians could stand a chance against[AN]
a Rigelian military invasion,[NL]
but we did all that and more.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Are you really saying that's just[NL]
set dressing in your [0x93]cosmic play[0x94]?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No[Beat] No, you're right. We all[NL]
fought together to get here.[AN]
We all put aside our differences[NL]
to focus on a shared goal,[AN]
and we made it happen as a team.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I wouldn't be here without all of you.[AN]
[MidRight]
There ya go.[.4] And that's a proven fact.[AN]
Personally, I'd put a lot more stock[NL]
in that than some fairy-tale that[AN]
a dude who doesn't even remember[NL]
his own name told you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[.4] You've got a point.[AN]
Maybe it isn't the gods[NL]
that guided me here after all.[AN]
