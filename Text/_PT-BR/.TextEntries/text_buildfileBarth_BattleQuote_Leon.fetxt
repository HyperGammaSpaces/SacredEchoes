My, my. You're as[NL]
disgusting in person as[AN]
I thought you'd be.[AN]
And I'm not just talking[NL]
about your face.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadBarth]
Yar, pipe down, pretty boy![NL]
Ye'll regret crossing me[AN]
when I cleave ye[NL]
to the brisket![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLeon]
Do you think a bilge rat[NL]
like yourself can scare ME?[AN]
You should know that my[NL]
claws come out when you[AN]
mess with someone I love![AN]
