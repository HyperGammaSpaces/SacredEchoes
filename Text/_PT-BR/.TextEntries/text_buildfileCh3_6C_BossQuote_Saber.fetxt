[MidLeft][LoadBlake]
Saber, aye? How fortunate.[NL]
Fate has seen fit to allow[AN]
me to deliver what you[NL]
so cravenly fled from![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadSaber]
Shut your yap, boot-licker.[NL]
You're nothing in a[AN]
one-on-one fight[NL]
without your noble pals[AN]
to hide behind.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadBlake][ToggleSmile]
My blade says otherwise.[NL]
I'll collect a fine bounty[AN]
when I present your head[NL]
to Lord Berkut![AN][ClearFace]
