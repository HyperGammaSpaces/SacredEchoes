[MidLeft][LoadJedah]
Miserable boy...[AN]
I see now I should have[NL]
slain you myself[AN]
the moment you set your[NL]
cowardly feet back upon[AN]
Lord Duma's soil![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadConrad]
Unfortunately for you,[NL]
Jedah, you vile fiend,[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadConrad_Maskless]
I'm done with running[NL]
and hiding.[AN]
For the sake of Anthiese,[NL]
and for Halcyon too,[AN]
I will stop you myself![AN]
