Any unit can rescue a blue or[NL]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[NL]
However, your constitution must[NL]
be higher than that of the unit[NL]
you're trying to rescue.[NL]
The rescuing unit suffers a[NL]
penalty in speed and skill,[NL]
but the rescued unit is[NL]
protected from attacks.[NL]
If a unit is about to lose all[NL]
of its HP, use the rescue[NL]
command to whisk it to safety.
