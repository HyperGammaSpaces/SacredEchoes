Some items have a limited number[NL]
of uses. Each time you use an[NL]
item, its durability goes down.[NL]
The number next to an item shows[NL]
how many times it can be used.[NL]
When that number reaches 0, the[NL]
item breaks and disappears.[NL]
Be careful not to let items drop[NL]
to 0 in the heat of battle.
