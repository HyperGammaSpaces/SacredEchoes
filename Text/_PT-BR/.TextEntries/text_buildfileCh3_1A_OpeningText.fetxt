Sir Alm! Our scouts have spied[NL]
Rigelian forces up ahead![AN]
[Right]
[Beat] ...Then the battle[NL]
begins here.[AN]
[FarRight]
So it seems.[AN]
The fights ahead will be nothing like[NL]
our skirmishes in the south.[AN]
You've wounded Rigel's pride, and[NL]
they will strike back without mercy.[AN]
But the spirit of Zofia[NL]
demands you prevail.[AN]
There's no turning back now.[AN]
[Right]
I know.[AN]
