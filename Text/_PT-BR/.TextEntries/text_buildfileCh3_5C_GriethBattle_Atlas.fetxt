[MidRight][LoadAtlas]
So you're the knucklehead[NL]
that locked up my brothers,[AN]
huh? Well, I've got a good[AN]
place for my knuckles to be[NL]
going--right in your face![AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadGrieth]
You dumb muscle types[NL]
are all the same.[AN]
I'd like to see you try[NL]
and land a hit on me,[AN]
stupid kid![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadAtlas]
Gladly! Even if I can't,[AN]
I'll punch your throne[NL]
to bits instead! Rrragh![AN]
