#0x60D Guide_ViewUnits
Units are divided into the[NL]
following three types:[NL]
    Player (blue)[NL]
    Enemy (red)[NL]
    Neutral (green)[NL]
Blue units are controlled by the[NL]
player. Red units are the enemy[NL]
units the player must defeat.[NL]
Red units will attack both blue[NL]
and green units, so be careful.
[X]

## Guide_GameFlow
Units take turns moving in[NL]
the following order:[NL]
    1. Player (blue)[NL]
    2. Enemy (red)[NL]
    3. Neutral (green)
[X]

## Guide_GameOver
If a main character's Hit Points[NL]
are reduced to zero, the game[NL]
ends.
[X]

## Guide_MovementRange
The blue area that appears[NL]
when you select a unit is[NL]
its movement range. Place the[NL]
cursor on an enemy unit to see[NL]
its movement range.
[X]

## Guide_MoveAgain
Mounted units can move again[NL]
after visiting homes or villages[NL]
if they have movement remaining.[NL]
This is most common among[NL]
cavaliers and pegasus knights.
[X]

## Guide_AttackRange
The red area that appears when[NL]
you select a unit is its[NL]
attack range. Place the cursor[NL]
on an enemy unit to see its[NL]
attack range.
[X]

## Guide_WeaponTriangle
Each weapon type has its own[NL]
strengths and weaknesses.[NL]
Swords do well against axes.[NL]
Axes do well against lances.[NL]
Lances do well against swords.[NL]
This is called the[NL]
Weapon Triangle.
[X]

## Guide_MagRes
Classes which can use magic,[NL]
such as mages and clerics,[NL]
will learn new spells as they[NL]
reach certain levels.[NL]
Spells which cause damage[NL]
are known as black magic,[NL]
while spells that heal or[NL]
cause other effects are called[NL]
white magic.[NL]
Spells are powerful tools both[NL]
inside and outside of combat,[NL]
but they usually cost HP to cast,[NL]
so be aware of the tradeoff.[NL]
A unit's RES stat reduces[NL]
the damage it takes from[NL]
the opponent's magic.[NL]
Additionally, the Dread Fighter[NL]
class takes halved damage[NL]
from magical attacks, making[NL]
them effective for fighting[NL]
powerful magic users.
[X]

## Guide_Effectiveness
Some weapons are especially[NL]
effective against certain units.[NL]
These weapons will cause heavy[NL]
damage to those units. For[NL]
example, bows are particularly[NL]
effective against flying units.[NL]
The weapon icons in the combat[NL]
information window will glow[NL]
when your unit is facing an[NL]
enemy that is weak against[NL]
that weapon.
[X]

## Guide_Critical
Critical hits inflict three times[NL]
the normal damage to enemies.[NL]
Your chance of a critical strike[NL]
changes depending on your unit's[NL]
attributes and the weapon with[NL]
which you are attacking.
[X]

## Guide_Defense
Any attack from a weapon is a[NL]
physical attack. Each unit's[NL]
DEF (defense) attribute[NL]
shows how well he defends[NL]
against physical attacks. The[NL]
higher the number, the less[NL]
damage he takes. Knights and[NL]
mercenaries have good defense.
[X]

## Guide_MovementSkills
Some classes have additional[NL]
abilities connected to movement[NL]
that they can use when near[NL]
other units. There are four[NL]
such abilities:[NL]
1. Shove[NL]
(Allows a unit to push an ally[NL]
one tile away)[NL]
2. Smite[NL]
(Allows a unit to push an ally[NL]
two tiles away)[NL]
3. Swap[NL]
(Allows a unit to trade places[NL]
with an adjacent ally)[NL]
4. Pivot[NL]
(Allows a unit to move to the[NL]
opposite side of an ally)[NL]
Shove and Smite can be used[NL]
on red or green units as well,[NL]
if the user's constitution[NL]
is higher than the target's.[NL]
Some units, such as bosses,[NL]
cannot be shoved.
[X]

## Guide_RestoringHP
Restore HP to your units by using[NL]
vulneraries and white magic.[NL]
Vulneraries and elixirs heal[NL]
only the user, while white magic[NL]
costs the user's HP to heal[NL]
a target unit. Choose your[NL]
healing method carefully.
[X]

## Guide_Status
There are four abnormal states[NL]
a unit can enter:[NL]
1. Freeze[NL]
(Paralyzed and unable to move)[NL]
2. Silence[NL]
(Unable to use any magic)[NL]
3. Poison[NL]
(Take continual damage)[NL]
4. Petrify[NL]
(Turned to stone, cannot move)[NL]
These conditions will continue for[NL]
several turns. They can be[NL]
reversed with a Restore spell.
[X]

## Guide_Strat
Here is the information shown if[NL]
you choose the strategic[NL]
combat information window:[NL]
[NL]
HP: Unit's remaining HP.[NL]
MT: Amount of damage the[NL]
equipped weapon inflicts.[NL]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.[NL]
CRIT: Chance the weapon will[NL]
land a critical blow.
[X]

## Guide_Detail
Here is the information shown if[NL]
you choose the detailed[NL]
combat information window:[NL]
[NL]
HP: Unit's remaining HP.[NL]
ATK: Amount of damage your[NL]
attack will inflict.[NL]
DEF: Amount of damage enemy[NL]
attacks will be reduced by.[NL]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.[NL]
CRIT: Chance the weapon will land[NL]
a critical blow.[NL]
AS: The speed of each unit's[NL]
attack, which determines how[NL]
many attacks each unit makes.
[X]

## Guide_Rescue
Any unit can rescue a blue or[NL]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[NL]
However, your constitution must[NL]
be higher than that of the unit[NL]
you're trying to rescue.[NL]
The rescuing unit suffers a[NL]
penalty in speed and skill,[NL]
but the rescued unit is[NL]
protected from attacks.[NL]
If a unit is about to lose all[NL]
of its HP, use the rescue[NL]
command to whisk it to safety.
[X]

## Guide_Drop
You can drop a rescued unit into[NL]
any adjacent tile. The dropped[NL]
unit will not be able to move[NL]
until the next turn.
[X]

## Guide_GetItems
You can purchase items at[NL]
shops. You can also pick them[NL]
up by visiting villagers and[NL]
opening chests. Enemies[NL]
sometimes drop items when[NL]
they are defeated.
[X]

## Guide_UseItems
Choose an item from the item[NL]
list and press the A Button[NL]
to use it. Items that cannot[NL]
be used by that unit will be[NL]
grayed out.
[X]

## Guide_TradeItems
You can trade items with units[NL]
in adjacent tiles. Select Trade[NL]
on the command menu, and then[NL]
select the unit with whom you[NL]
want to trade. Next, place the[NL]
cursor on the item you want to[NL]
take from the other unit's[NL]
inventory and press the A Button[NL]
to receive that item.
[X]

## Guide_Durability
Some items have a limited number[NL]
of uses. Each time you use an[NL]
item, its durability goes down.[NL]
The number next to an item shows[NL]
how many times it can be used.[NL]
When that number reaches 0, the[NL]
item breaks and disappears.[NL]
Be careful not to let items drop[NL]
to 0 in the heat of battle.
[X]

## Guide_Convoy
A supply convoy travels with[NL]
your main character. If you[NL]
move to a space adjacent your[NL]
supply convoy, you can trade[NL]
items with it. On the battle[NL]
preparation screen, you can[NL]
also buy and sell items at the[NL]
supply convoy. The convoy can[NL]
store up to 200 items for you.[NL]
On Normal or Hard difficulty,[NL]
Alm and Celica's parties will[NL]
each have separate halves.
[X]

## Guide_Armory
Move a unit onto an armory and[NL]
then choose Armory to buy[NL]
weapons. You can also sell[NL]
items you've collected here.
[X]

## Guide_Vendor
Move a unit onto a shop and[NL]
then choose Shop to buy and[NL]
sell items such as vulneraries,[NL]
keys and torches.
[X]

## Guide_AvoidTerrain
Forests and mountains give[NL]
units additional cover. When[NL]
your units are in these tiles,[NL]
enemy hit percentages will be[NL]
reduced. When entering attack[NL]
range, try to stop in one of[NL]
these spaces. However, the hit[NL]
chance of magic is not affected[NL]
by terrain bonuses.
[X]

## Guide_HealTiles
Any unit that ends its turn[NL]
on a fortress, supply tile,[NL]
gate, or throne will regain[NL]
some HP automatically at the[NL]
beginning of the next turn.[NL]
Additionally, special rings[NL]
can be held to restore HP[NL]
from anywhere, and can even be[NL]
combined with the recovery[NL]
from these terrain types.
[X]

## Guide_Houses
Move a unit to a house to visit[NL]
the occupants of that house.[NL]
This is a good way of gaining[NL]
useful information that might[NL]
turn the battle in your favor.[NL]
Visit houses whenever you get[NL]
the opportunity.
[X]

## Guide_Villages
Move a unit to a village to[NL]
speak with its villagers.[NL]
You can gain information,[NL]
items, and even money from[NL]
villages, so visit them if[NL]
you have the opportunity.[NL]
[X]

## Guide_Chests
Move units onto spaces with[NL]
chests to open them. Chests[NL]
are filled with all sorts of[NL]
useful items. However, you'll[NL]
need a chest key or lockpicks[NL]
to open the chest.
[X]

a river, knock it over to[NL]
form an impromptu bridge.
[X]

## Guide_BreakWalls
Attack cracked walls to[NL]
destroy them and create[NL]
new paths.
[X]

## Guide_FOW
Darkness and fog limit your[NL]
field of vision, preventing[NL]
you from seeing distant enemies.[NL]
Use thieves, torches, and[NL]
Torch spells to increase your[NL]
field of vision.
[X]

## Guide_Ballistae
These siege weapons[NL]
fire missiles from long[NL]
distances. Place an archer or[NL]
sniper on them to use them.
[X]

## Guide_Recruiting
On your quest, you will run[NL]
across many characters who[NL]
might join your cause. Watch[NL]
story hints carefully to find[NL]
who should talk to these[NL]
characters and convince them[NL]
to join you.
[X]

## Guide_Permadeath
Except in rare cases, if one of[NL]
your units loses all of its HP,[NL]
it will retreat from battle and be[NL]
unable to fight again. Be careful![NL]
In Casual mode, fallen units will[NL]
return in the following chapter.[NL]
[X]

## Guide_SupportConvo
Some units have special bonds[NL]
between them. The longer they[NL]
spend in adjoining spaces, the[NL]
stronger that bond will grow.[NL]
Once this bond is strong enough,[NL]
the Support command will appear[NL]
on the command menu.[NL]
Select it to make the characters[NL]
share a support conversation.[NL]
[X]

## Guide_SupportEffects
If supportive units are within[NL]
three spaces of each other they[NL]
both gain special combat[NL]
bonuses. There are three levels[NL]
of support. The higher the level,[NL]
the better the bonuses received.[NL]
Support levels increase each[NL]
time units share a conversation.
[X]

## Guide_GreenUnits
Green units are neutral. They[NL]
may become allies if you speak[NL]
to them. If you move to a space[NL]
adjacent to a green unit, the[NL]
Talk command may appear.[NL]
Choose [0x93]Talk[0x94] to convince the[NL]
unit to join you.
[X]

## Guide_RedUnits
Some enemy units will join you[NL]
if you talk to them. Move a[NL]
character you think might know[NL]
that enemy unit into a space[NL]
adjacent to it to see if they[NL]
can talk.[NL]
Be careful! Enemy units will[NL]
continue to attack until you[NL]
talk to them! Try not to take[NL]
them out or be taken out before[NL]
you have a chance to chat.
[X]

main character and pressing[NL]
the A Button.
[X]

on the world map. Moving onto[NL]
the same location as an enemy[NL]
will cause a battle to begin.[NL]
If you haven't cleared the[NL]
chapter at that location yet,[NL]
the enemy will bolster the[NL]
numbers of the opposing army[NL]
in the chapter battle, so[NL]
take them out quickly!

#0x640 Guide_EXP
Units gain EXP (experience[NL]
points) by fighting and by using[NL]
magic. They go up a level when[NL]
they earn 100 EXP. As they go[NL]
up in level, characters become[NL]
stronger, more skilled, etc.[NL]
The highest level is level 20.[NL]
The more advanced the unit's[NL]
class is, the slower it levels.
[X]

#0x641 Guide_ClassChange
Most units can change classes[NL]
once they reach a certain level.[NL]
This level varies by class, but[NL]
is indicated with an icon of[NL]
a winged Mila statue on the[NL]
unit's status screen.[NL]
When standing next to a Mila[NL]
Statue on a battle map,[NL]
the Mila option will appear[NL]
in the command menu.[NL]
Changing classes will bring[NL]
a unit's stats up to the bases[NL]
of the new class.[NL]
Villagers can choose from 5[NL]
classes to promote into,[NL]
but those and other classes[NL]
have a set promotion order,[NL]
