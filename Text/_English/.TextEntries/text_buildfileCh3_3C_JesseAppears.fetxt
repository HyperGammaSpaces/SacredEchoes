[MidLeft][LoadJesse]

Well then![AN]

Gotta say, that's the least fun I've had[NL]

getting out of a pair of handcuffs.[AN]

I guess I'll just have to try my luck[NL]

at the OTHER giant desert fortress.[AN]

But, while I'm here...[NL]

if I can't free any other prisoners,[AN]

I might as well free some of[NL]

these ill-gotten treasures.[AN]
