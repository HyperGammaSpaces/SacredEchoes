Just between us sailors, there's said[NL]

to be treasure at the Seabound Shrine.[AN]

Treasure so fantastic, there's a dragon[NL]

that guards it.[.5] A dead one.[AN]

If you had the Seraphim spell, you might[NL]

stand a chance against it...[AN]

Well, all I have to give is this sword.[NL]

No telling if it'll help.[.5] Good luck.[AN]
