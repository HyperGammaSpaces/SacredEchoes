...Desaix's dying words[NL]

sure were strange.[AN]

Something about my grandfather[NL]

and Emperor Rudolf.[AN]

What would Sir Mycen and the Rigelian[NL]

emperor have to do with each other?[AN]

I can't put my finger on it, but[NL]

there's this weird feeling[AN]

I can't seem to shake.[AN]

It feels like every victory I secure[NL]

takes me one step further from Zofia.[AN]
