Uuuugh.[.4] Are we there yet?[NL]
I'm gettin' blisters on my blisters.[AN]
And the air up here's colder[NL]
than a witch's--[AN]
[Left][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadForsyth]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry,[.4] are you whining?[NL]
Was that a whine?[AN]
In case it slipped your mind,[NL]
the fate of all Zofia is at stake.[AN]
We've half a mountain more to scale,[NL]
and your blithering isn't making it go[AN]
any faster.[.4][MoveMidRight] Honestly, Python![AN]
[FarLeft]
Listen,[.4] I came here to do war,[.4] not the[NL]
Ultimate Incline Butt Workout Challenge.[AN]
This isn't even the way to the castle![AN]
[MidRight]
Perhaps if you'd put a little more[NL]
work into horsemanship,[.4] your legs[AN]
wouldn't be aching like this![AN]
Besides,[.4] we're doing a good deed--[AN]
and that's worth doing,[NL]
even for the enemy's sake.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Doesn't change the fact that we're[NL]
still waging war against their country.[AN]
I don't know why Sir Grandson cares so[NL]
damn much about how the people feel[AN]
as we're cutting down their men and[NL]
trampling over all their stuff.[AN]
A leader's gotta be okay with getting[NL]
hated for doing what needs to be done.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've always admired how Sir Clive[NL]
handles it with such grace.[AN]
I suppose it would be for the best if[NL]
Alm were to learn from his example...[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
See?[.4] You l[.4]o[.4]v[.4]e[.4] when I'm right.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Don't gloat on it too much,[.4] now![NL]
Put that enthusiasm into your march![AN]

Sir Alm,[.4] please,[.4] if I may.[AN]
[Left][MoveRight][Right][ClearFace][Right][LoadAlm]
What's up,[.4] Silque?[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I've brought a fresh skin of water.[AN]
At high altitudes like this,[.4] it's[NL]
imperative to keep your thirst slaked.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Oh yeah,[.4] thanks.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And if the thorns are getting to you,[AN]
this broad-leaved herb that grows by[NL]
the wayside relieves cuts and scrapes...[AN]
[Right]
Heh.[.4] I wouldn't have guessed[NL]
you were an avid hillwalker.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I've been traveling all my life,[.4][NL]
across all sorts of terrain.[AN]
At times,[.4] for pilgrimage,[.4] but often[NL]
just for the experience of it.[AN]
[Right]
Even mountains like this?[NL]
You don't seem winded at all...[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well,[.4] to tell the truth...[.4] my mother's[NL]
village was near this mountain range.[AN]
I only spent a few years here,[.4] but[NL]
she taught me much about these slopes.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
Wait,[.4] what?[.4] You're Rigelian...?[AN]
[MidLeft]
By blood,[.4] yes,[.4] but I serve Mila.[AN][CloseEyes]
It was so long ago that[NL]
I rarely speak of it...[AN][OpenEyes]
I hope you can understand, Sir Alm.[AN]
I've no loyalties left here[NL]
beyond that of human life.[AN]
[Right]
No, no,[.4] I don't doubt that.[NL]
I was just a little surprised.[AN]
And when all's said and done,[AN]
I sure am glad you ended up[NL]
in Zofia with us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am, too.[.4] Truly.[AN]
[Beat]Er,[.4] anyway,[.4] you seem to be[NL]
doing well with the mountain air,[AN]
but I think the other Zofians[NL]
might need my help.[AN]
If I may be excused...?[AN]
[Right]
Sure thing.[.4] Thanks, Silque.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][.6]
[Right]
...Weird.[.4] I feel fine...[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm glad you're giving your horse[NL]
so many breaks, Clive,[AN]
but it's making me wonder if I've[NL]
been leading the march too fast.[AN]
[MidRight]
The air is starting to[NL]
get noticeably thinner.[AN]
My squires weren't able to keep up,[AN]
so the task of tending to my mount[NL]
falls to me in their absence.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry.[.4] I can slow the pace[NL]
if that's a problem.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
It is a lot of work, but it isn't[NL]
a burden. I quite enjoy it, actually.[AN][CloseEyes]
It reminds me of when Fernand and I[NL]
were fresh squires ourselves,[AN]
looking after the knights' war-horses[NL]
and dreaming of our own someday...[AN]
[MidLeft]
I can believe it.[AN]
I sometimes helped Grandfather[NL]
with his horse when I was little,[AN]
but the sheep were the ones[NL]
that really needed minding.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Heh... it may come as a surprise,[NL]
but I once learned that the hard way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Really? Oh, I gotta hear this one.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Er, I suppose I could tell it[NL]
as we continue up the mountainside,[AN]
but I wouldn't want you to get winded[NL]
trying to keep pace with my horse...[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll be fine.[AN]
The air here doesn't bother me[NL]
as much as our other soldiers.[AN]
[MidRight]
Truly?[.4] Well, all right then.[NL][ToggleSmile]
When I was about your age...[AN]

Oh, dear.[.4] Such naughty children,[NL]
lashing out at Lord Duma so![AN]
You've earned quite the punishment...[AN]

Another witch?[.4] [MoveLeft]Listen to me--[NL]
you're being controlled![AN]
You have to fight this![AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm sorry, Alm.[.4] You can't help her.[AN]
Only death can break Duma's hold over[NL]
those who have offered up their souls.[AN]
[Left]
No...[AN]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
It's sad,[.4] but not uncommon,[NL]
in a land so thirsty for power.[AN]
[Left]
That's horrible...[.4] If we fall,[NL]
and Rigel occupies Zofia,[AN]
our people could suffer[NL]
the same awful fate...[AN][MoveLeft]
I won't allow it to happen![AN]

## Ch4_3A_Barons
[MidLeft][LoadForsyth]
What impressive armor[NL]
those barons have...[AN][ToggleSmile]
Someday,[.4] mine will shine[NL]
as gloriously as theirs![AN]
[Red]Arrows have no hope[Red] of[NL]
piercing armor that sturdy.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Heh,[.4] Python won't dare to[NL]
pick fights with me then...[AN]

Hello?[.4] Is anyone there?[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Get out of here,[.4] Zofian scum![AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wait![.4] We come in peace.[AN]
This isn't the way to the castle.[NL]
We intend to march on Nuibaba's manor.[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadWoman]
Hold, everyone.[.4] If this is true...[NL]
Let me speak with them.[AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight]
The witch Nuibaba gathers young and[NL]
comely girls from all across Rigel.[AN]
She makes sacrifices of them,[.4] feeds them[NL]
to monsters to preserve her own youth.[AN]
My daughter was spirited away to her[NL]
manor months ago and never returned...[AN]
I fear the worst may have happened.[AN]
[MidLeft]
She's even worse than we thought...[NL]
We'll put a stop to her.[.4] We swear it.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
You would truly do that...?[AN]
My daughter's a cavalier of some[NL]
repute,[.4] but left her lance with me.[AN]
If it will aid you in her rescue,[NL]
please take it.[AN]
May Duma's blessings be with you.[AN]

Oh, my.[.4] They're really misbehaving.[NL]
Why don't I recruit some extra help?[AN]
Come, sisters.[.4] Teach them[NL]
the error of their ways...[AN]

So there's really no[NL]
cure for witches...?[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
None which has been discovered,[.4] sadly.[NL][OpenEyes]
It's an irreversible sacrifice.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Alm--[.4]listen.[NL]
I know what you're thinking.[AN]
We're an invading army,[NL]
not a rescue team.[AN]
We have neither the time[NL]
nor the resources to save[AN]
all those who have been turned.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I know that.[.4] But still...[AN]
[MidRight]
What we CAN do,[.4] though,[.4] since we[NL]
are nearly to Nuibaba's manor,[AN]
is finish what we've started.[AN]
There is still a possibility that[NL]
slaying her will dispel any hexes[AN]
she's cast on her victims.[AN]
Whether or not this theory holds true,[AN]
it would be more than enough for me[NL]
to take as having done all we can.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
...Thank you, Lukas.[.4] When you put it[NL]
like that,[.4] it's easier to swallow.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Everyone![.4] We march on the[NL]
mountainside at dawn![AN]

Lady Rinea.[.4] How do you fare?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh,[.4] Sir Fernand![NL]
I'm in good spirits.[AN]
The maidservants just brought[NL]
a fresh pot of tea.[AN]
Would you stay for some?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I see.[.4] Good to hear.[NL]
I suppose I can sit a spell.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
My Lord Berkut has been spending much[NL]
more time at the temple of late...[AN][ToggleSmile]
It's nice to have someone[NL]
to talk to in his absence.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mm.[.4] ...It has me concerned.[.4] I haven't[NL]
known him to be particularly religious.[AN]
And after the way he shouted at you...[AN]
Truth be told,[.4] I...[.4] came to see[NL]
if you were all right.[AN]
[MidRight]
O-[.4]Oh.[.5] I,[.4] um[Beat] I appreciate[NL]
the concern, Sir Fernand.[AN]
But I'm all right.[NL]
I know he meant nothing by it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...My apologies.[.4] I did not[NL]
mean to pry.[.4] I merely felt...[AN]
well,[.4] that it isn't proper for a man[NL]
to speak like that to his betrothed.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]You are kind,[.4] Sir Fernand.[NL]
Kind and principled.[AN]
I'd hope Lord Berkut might[NL]
learn from your example.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm afraid I'm no example[NL]
to follow in such matters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[.5] How do you mean?[AN]
[FarLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
In my homeland,[.4] there was[Beat][NL]
someone very, very dear to me.[AN]
Someone who was the light of my life,[AN]
but to whom,[.4] in my darkest hours,[.4][NL]
I learned I was only a dying ember.[AN][OpenEyes]
And in my hurt and anger,[.4] I said[NL]
some truly terrible things.[AN]
Things that would be unforgivable[NL]
to an older and wiser heart.[AN]
But even now,[.4] that person[Beat][NL]
refuses to give up on me.[AN][CloseEyes]
Every awful dagger of hate I throw[AN]
is met only with open arms and[NL]
those forlorn and wistful eyes.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft][OpenEyes]
When I look at you,[.4] I[Beat][NL]
I think of that person.[AN]
I think of the pain I've caused.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.6]
[FarLeft]
I think...[.4] I have an[NL]
apology I must make.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]I'm[.5] sure that person[NL]
will be glad to hear it.[AN]
No matter how long the wait...[.4][NL]
I know it would soothe their soul.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...Thank you,[.4] Lady Rinea.[NL]
I've some preparations to make.[AN][ClearFace][.6]
