Uuuugh.[.4] Are we there yet?[NL]
I'm gettin' blisters on my blisters.[AN]
And the air up here's colder[NL]
than a witch's--[AN]
[Left][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadForsyth]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry, are you whining?[NL]
Was that a whine?[AN]
In case it slipped your mind,[NL]
the fate of all Zofia is at stake.[AN]
We've half a mountain more yet to scale,[NL]
and your blithering isn't making it go[AN]
any faster.[MoveMidRight] Honestly, Python![AN]
[FarLeft]
Listen, I came here to do war, not the[NL]
Ultimate Incline Butt Workout Challenge.[AN]
This isn't even the way to the castle![AN]
[MidRight]
Perhaps if you'd put a little more[NL]
work into horsemanship, your legs[AN]
wouldn't be aching like this![AN]
Besides, we're doing a good deed.[AN]
We'll be slaying a tyrannical witch and[NL]
earning trust from the Rigelian people.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Doesn't change the fact that we're[NL]
still waging war against their country.[AN]
I don't know why Sir Grandson cares so[NL]
damn much about how the people feel[AN]
as we're cutting down their men and[NL]
trampling over all their stuff.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Are you saying you[NL]
want to turn back?![AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Have a LITTLE faith in me, big guy.[NL]
I'm just sayin' a leader's gotta[AN]
be okay with getting hated for[NL]
doing what needs to be done.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]
[Beat][OpenEyes]
Bah, you've got a point.[AN]
I've always admired how Sir Clive[NL]
handles it with such grace.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
See? You l[.4]o[.4]v[.4]e[.4] when I'm right.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Don't gloat on it too much, now![NL]
Put that enthusiasm into your march![AN]

[MidRight][LoadClive]
The air is starting to[NL]
get noticeably thinner.[AN]
Fear Mountain won't be[NL]
much further beyond.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Understood. Let's scout[NL]
the area for making camp.[AN]

## Ch4_3A_OpeningText_2
[MidRight][LoadMarla]
Oh, dear. Such naughty children,[NL]
lashing out at Lord Duma so![AN]
You've earned quite the punishment...[AN]

[Left][LoadAlm][Left]
Another witch? [MoveLeft]Listen to me--[NL]
you're being controlled![AN]
You have to fight this![AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm sorry, Alm. You can't help her.[AN]
Only death can break Duma's hold over[NL]
those who have offered up their souls.[AN]
[Left]
No...[AN]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
It's sad, but not uncommon,[NL]
in a land so thirsty for power.[AN]
[Left]
That's horrible... If we fall,[NL]
and Rigel occupies Zofia,[AN]
our people could suffer[NL]
the same awful fate...[AN][MoveLeft]
I won't allow it to happen![AN]
[X]

## Ch4_3A_Barons
[MidLeft][LoadForsyth]
What impressive armor[NL]
those barons have...[AN][ToggleSmile]
Someday, mine will shine[NL]
as gloriously as theirs![AN]
[Red]Arrows have no hope[Red] of[NL]
piercing armor that sturdy.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Heh, Python won't dare to[NL]
pick fights with me then...[AN]

## Ch4_3A_VillageText
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Hello? Is anyone there?[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Get out of here, Zofian scum![AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wait! We come in peace.[AN]
This isn't the way to the castle.[NL]
We intend to march on Nuibaba's manor.[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadWoman]
Hold, everyone. If this is true...[NL]
Let me speak with them.[AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight]
The witch Nuibaba gathers young and[NL]
comely girls from all across Rigel.[AN]
She makes sacrifices of them, feeds them[NL]
to monsters to preserve her own youth.[AN]
My daughter was spirited away to her[NL]
manor months ago and never returned...[AN]
I fear the worst may have happened.[AN]
[MidLeft]
She's even worse than we thought...[NL]
We'll put a stop to her. We swear it.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
You would truly do that...?[AN]
My daughter's a cavalier of some[NL]
repute, but left her lance with me.[AN]
If it will aid you in her rescue,[NL]
please take it.[AN]
May Duma's blessings be with you.[AN]

## Ch4_3A_MarlaSummons
[MidRight][LoadMarla]
Oh, my. They're really misbehaving.[NL]
Why don't I recruit some extra help?[AN]
Come, sisters. Teach them[NL]
the error of their ways...[AN]
[X]

## Ch4_3A_MarlaBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadMarla]
Hee... I'll sing[NL]
you a lullaby...[AN]
It's time for all the[NL]
good little children[AN]
to go to sleep.[A]

## Ch4_3A_MarlaDeathQuote
[MidLeft][LoadMarla]
Oh dear... Such...[NL]
stubborn children...[AN]
You should...[NL][CloseEyes]
listen to...your...[A]

## Ch4_3A_EndingText
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
So there's really no[NL]
cure for witches...?[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
None which has been discovered, sadly.[NL][OpenEyes]
It's an irreversible sacrifice.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Alm--[.4]listen.[NL]
I know what you're thinking.[AN]
We're an invading army,[NL]
not a rescue team.[AN]
We have neither the time[NL]
nor the resources to save[AN]
all those who have been turned.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I know that. But still...[AN]
[MidRight]
What we CAN do, though, since we[NL]
are nearly to Nuibaba's manor,[AN]
is finish what we've started.[AN]
There is still a possibility that[NL]
slaying her will dispel any hexes[AN]
she's cast on her victims.[AN]
Whether or not this theory holds true,[AN]
it would be more than enough for me[NL]
to take as having done all we can.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
...Thank you, Lukas.[.4] When you put it[NL]
like that, it's easier to swallow.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Everyone![.4] We march on the[NL]
mountainside at dawn![AN]

[FarFarLeft][LoadFernand][.5][MoveFarLeft][FarLeft]
Lady Rinea. How do you fare?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, Sir Fernand![NL]
I'm in good spirits.[AN]
The maidservants just brought[NL]
a fresh pot of tea.[AN]
Would you stay for some?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I see. Good to hear.[NL]
I suppose I can sit a spell.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
My Lord Berkut has been spending much[NL]
more time at the temple of late...[AN][ToggleSmile]
It's nice to have someone[NL]
to talk to in his absence.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mm.[.4] ...It has me concerned.[.4] I haven't[NL]
known him to be particularly religious.[AN]
And after the way he shouted at you...[AN]
Truth be told, I... came to see[NL]
if you were all right.[AN]
[MidRight]
O-[.4]Oh.[.5] I, um[Beat] I appreciate[NL]
the concern, Sir Fernand.[AN]
But I'm all right.[NL]
I know he meant nothing by it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...My apologies. I did not[NL]
mean to pry. I merely felt...[AN]
well, that it isn't proper for a man[NL]
to speak like that to his betrothed.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]You are kind, Sir Fernand.[NL]
Kind and principled.[AN]
I'd hope Lord Berkut might[NL]
learn from your example.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm afraid I'm no example[NL]
to follow in such matters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[.5] How do you mean?[AN]
[FarLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
In my homeland, there was[Beat][NL]
someone very, very dear to me.[AN]
Someone who was the light of my life,[AN]
but to whom, in my darkest hours,[NL]
I learned I was only a dying ember.[AN][OpenEyes]
And in my hurt and anger, I said[NL]
some truly terrible things.[AN]
Things that would be unforgivable[NL]
to an older and wiser heart.[AN]
But even now, that person[Beat][NL]
refuses to give up on me.[AN][CloseEyes]
Every awful dagger of hate I throw[AN]
is met only with open arms and[NL]
those forlorn and wistful eyes.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft][OpenEyes]
When I look at you, I[Beat][NL]
I think of that person.[AN]
I think of the pain I've caused.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.6]
[FarLeft]
I think... I have an[NL]
apology I must make.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]I'm[.5] sure that person[NL]
will be glad to hear it.[AN]
No matter how long the wait...[NL]
I know it would soothe their soul.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...Thank you, Lady Rinea.[NL]
I've some preparations to make.[AN][ClearFace][.6]
