Something wrong,[.4] lass?[AN]
The closer we get to Duma Tower,[NL]
the quieter you become.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[.4][MoveMidLeft] No I don't! [Beat]Er,[.4] do I?[AN]
I suppose I'm just getting a[NL]
bit nervous as we draw near.[AN]
[MidRight]
That it?[NL]
You're not hiding anything?[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes][.6][OpenEyes]
Saber,[.4] you're worrying over nothing.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You've been full of secrets[NL]
from the start,[.4] lass.[AN]
But I know you have your reasons.[AN][NL][.6]
I guess I thought by this point you'd[NL]
trust me enough to share some.[AN][ClearFace]

Duma Tower is just beyond this swamp.[NL]
Are you prepared,[.4] Anthiese?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]I am.[AN]
Even if it costs me my life,[.4][NL]
it's a sacrifice I must make.[AN]
But tell me.[.4] What is it you feel,[AN]
looking upon this tower and knowing[NL]
that it is the last place I'll see?[AN]
[MidLeft]
A tinge of sorrow,[.4] I'll not deny.[.4][NL][ToggleSmile]
But more than that,[.4] overwhelming pride.[AN]
Knowing that I stand in the presence of[NL]
the savior of the gods and the earth.[AN]
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]I see.[.4] Then let's get this[NL]
over with as quickly as possible.[AN]

Anthiese![.4] Don't listen to him![NL]
That isn't the knight who aided you![AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Right][MoveRight]
Wh-[.4]What?![AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Pah![.4] A charlatan,[.4] making[NL]
a tawdry attempt at distraction?![AN]
Pay that interloper no mind,[.4] Anthiese.[AN]
Such obtrusions are the[NL]
domain of desperate fools.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Anthiese,[.4] listen![.5] He intends to lead[NL]
you to your death![.4] He can't be trusted![AN]
[Right]
I...[.4] But still...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Pay no attention to that false knight.[AN]
He selfishly values Zofia's dynasty over[NL]
the fate of the gods and the whole world![AN]
You know what must be done![NL]
You know it to be true![AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Fiend![.4] I'll stop you myself![AN]
[Right][LoadCelica_Promoted_Angry][MoveRight]
E-[.4]Enough of this![.4] Drop your weapons![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][LoadOverworldFaces]
[Right][LoadCelica_Promoted]
I'll judge the truth[NL]
of your claims myself.[AN]
You will each ask the other[NL]
a single question.[AN]
The knight next to me...[AN]
For drawing his weapon first,[NL]
he must ask the first question.[AN]
[FarRight]
Very well.[.4] I accept.[AN]
What was the name of the priestess[NL]
who tended your wounds at the temple?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It was Irma,[.4] of course.[AN]
Do you truly think I'd forget her name[NL]
after risking my life to escort her?[AN]
[Right]
But Irma came up from the vault stairs[NL]
when I met her again in the temple.[AN][2NL]
...The infirmary is at ground level.[AN]

The knight who stands[NL]
across from me is the fake![AN]

Keh.[.4] Slimy dastard.[AN]
I've been itching for a chance[NL]

By the way,[.4] that [0x93]cute critter[0x94][NL]

They reproduce by splitting.[AN]
Careful not to let it multiply,[NL]

...I'm so sorry.[.4] I never thought[NL]
it would play out that way.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Anthiese,[.4] what in the name of all[NL]
that is good has gotten into you?![AN]
Were you truly planning all along[NL]
to consign yourself to a martyr's death?![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I can't price my own life higher[NL]
than the sum of all Zofians'.[AN]
I know that's not what[NL]
you want to hear,[.4] but--[AN]
[MidRight]
And you'd then leave the people of Zofia[NL]
with neither hope nor ruler?[AN]
The comrades you've led all this time,[NL]
without their commander and friend?[AN]
The people who care so deeply for you,[NL]
with the eternal burden of grief?![AN]
Even the gods cannot heal the gaping[NL]
hole left when a loved one is torn away.[AN][MoveMidRight]
Perhaps you should stop and think of that[NL]
before you sign away your last breath![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Promoted_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
--Do you think I haven't thought[NL]
about that enough already?![AN]
Do you think I know nothing of[NL]
the grief of losing loved ones?[AN]
Do you think I'm content to put[NL]
those I care about through it?[AN]
[MidRight]
I--[.4] I didn't...[AN]
[MidLeft]
The weight of the crown[.4] is the burden[NL]
of never being able to be enough.[AN]
Every choice I make is now[NL]
a matter of life and death.[AN]
Every confidant,[.4] a potential traitor.[AN]
Every decision,[.4] weighed for the[NL]
good of the people against[AN]
any want or need I might have.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
What could you possibly know of[NL]
what I'm dealing with right now?![AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] I know more[NL]
than you might think.[AN]
I understand the weight of royalty,[.4][NL]
its expectations,[.4] its isolation.[AN]
I saw[Beat] what it did to your family.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MidRight][MoveRight]
[Right]
To OUR family.[AN]

I can't lose you a second time,[.4][NL]
dear sister.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You[Beat] But that's[Beat] [MoveMidLeft]My brother?![NL]
Is it really you,[.4] Conrad?![AN]
But...[.4] The fire...![.4] I was so[NL]
certain it had taken you![AN]
[Right]
I managed to escape the night[NL]
they burned the villa.[AN]
My mother's maidservant led me to[NL]
safety,[.4] to our homeland of Rigel.[AN]
Desaix's reach is long,[.4] but even he[NL]
couldn't follow me into the empire.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I should hate you for letting me[NL]
mourn all this time,[.4] and yet...[AN][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
I'm so happy...[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
I was so worried about you.[AN]
I decided to follow and[NL]
make sure you were safe.[AN]
I never wanted to lie to you,[.4] but...[AN]
Well,[.4] you weren't the[NL]
only one in hiding.[AN]
[MidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
Conrad,[.4] you[Beat][OpenEyes] If only you'd[NL]
told me this earlier...[AN]
[Right]
I swore an oath to Halcyon that I[NL]
would tell no one,[.4] for my own safety.[AN]
But even more than that,[.4][NL]
I was[Beat] scared.[AN]
I was scared that if I revealed[NL]
myself,[.4] that I'd be taken hostage[AN]
and used to hurt you.[AN]
But it seems my cowardice[NL]
led to the same result.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Please don't blame yourself, Conrad.[AN]
Neither of us could have known that[NL]
Jedah would have such a disguise.[AN]
[Right]
Anthiese, I'm so sorry for[NL]
speaking that way to you.[AN]
You're the only family I[NL]
have left in this world.[AN]
It's true I can't know everything[NL]
of the burden you bear,[.4] but...[AN][ToggleSmile]
at least let me bear[NL]
part of it with you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Conrad...[.4] [CloseEyes]Sniff...[.4][NL][OpenEyes]
Oh,[.4] this is no time for tears.[AN][ToggleSmile]
We must enter Duma Tower.[AN]
Mila is there,[.4] and it is[NL]
imperative that I speak with her.[AN]
So please, Conrad,[.4] abide my burdens[NL]
and me for just a little longer.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You needn't even ask, Anthiese.[AN]
I'll be at your side and[NL]
protect you with my life.[AN]
