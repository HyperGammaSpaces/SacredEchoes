You don't have to feel uncomfortable.[NL]
I don't care what land you hail from![AN]
You're raising arms against that[NL]
rotten Jerome, and that makes you[AN]
a hero around here.[AN]
He and Nuibaba from up Fear Mountain[NL]
have caused us nothing but suffering.[AN]
And who came to our aid?[.4][MoveMidRight] Not the[NL]
emperor, nor the Duma Faithful![AN]
The only one who's stood up for us[NL]
was General Ezekiel.[AN]

Say, Alm.[.4] I know Jerome's men used[NL]

village down going a little far?[AN]

That's...[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
Tobin.[.4] I know how you must feel,[NL]
but we cannot ignore the possibility[AN]
that the Rigelian Army might retake[NL]
the village after we leave and use it[AN]
as a base to attack us from behind.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
But then, what about the villagers?[AN][2NL]
When they return to see[NL]
their village like this...[AN]
[MidRight]
The residents lost their home[NL]
the moment Jerome decided to[AN]
use it as a stronghold.[AN]
Unless they were so fervently[NL]
supportive of the enemy troops[AN]
that they were willing to house[NL]
and feed them at their own expense,[AN]
they've made their home[NL]

Not a man among us wishes this conflict[NL]
to last any longer than it must.[AN]

[Beat]Now that I have turned my lance[NL]

But neither can I offer that lance[NL]
to you. I still have no recollection[AN]
of who I am or from whence I came.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You've lost your memory?[AN]
[MidRight]
All I know is that I washed up on the[NL]
shores of Rigel grievously wounded.[AN]
I was thrown in prison and accused[NL]
of being a spy or worse.[AN]
But Emperor Rudolf saved me.[AN]
He gave me a name and took me in.[NL]
He treated me as if I were his own son.[AN][CloseEyes]
And yes, I may have betrayed him...[NL][.5][OpenEyes]

He said that if I met a man[NL]

I was to follow him.[AN]
[0x93]For that man is chosen,[0x94] he said.[NL]
[0x93]He shall save all of Rigel.[0x94][AN]

Pffft.[.4] Yeah, no pressure or anything.[AN]

Am I really just acting out a role[NL]

Zofians could stand a chance against[AN]

Are you really saying that's just[NL]
set dressing in your [0x93]cosmic play[0x94]?[AN]

No[Beat] No, you're right. We all[NL]

We all put aside our differences[NL]

and we made it happen as a team.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I wouldn't be here without all of you.[AN]
[MidRight]
There ya go.[.4] And that's a proven fact.[AN]
Personally, I'd put a lot more stock[NL]
