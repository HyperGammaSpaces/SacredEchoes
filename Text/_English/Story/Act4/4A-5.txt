You don't have to feel uncomfortable.[NL]

You're raising arms against that[NL]

[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
But then,[.4] what about the villagers?[AN][2NL]
When they return to see[NL]
their village like this...[AN]

The residents lost their home[NL]

You've lost your memory?[AN]

All I know is that I washed up on the[NL]

I was thrown in prison and accused[NL]

But Emperor Rudolf saved me.[AN]
He gave me a name and took me in.[NL]

I wouldn't be here without all of you.[AN]
