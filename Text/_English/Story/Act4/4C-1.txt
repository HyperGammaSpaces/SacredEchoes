I know it's been a while[NL]
since I've been back here,[AN]
but I don't remember the[NL]
ground being this damn mushy.[AN]
[Left]
Zofia and Rigel had an agreement[NL]
on the Sluice Gate to divert water[AN]
for crops between the two nations.[AN]
The drier Rigelian soil benefited[NL]
greatly from the waters[AN]
touched by Mila's blessing...[AN]
I can imagine that a breakdown of[NL]
that agreement would have led to[AN]
flooding here in the lowlands.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Doesn't surprise me.[AN]
That all went bust around[NL]
when Desaix came along.[AN]
Still doesn't explain[NL]
the miasma in the air...[AN]
[Left]
Right,[.4] that...[.4][NL][CloseEyes]
This place gives me chills.[AN][OpenEyes]
Small wonder it's got a charming[NL]
name like Dead Man's Mire.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I can handle dead men.[NL][MoveFarLeft]
It's this humidity that's killin' me![AN]
Let's clear a path[NL]
and get going already.[AN]
[Left]
No arguments here.[AN]

Heh heh heh[Beat][NL]
Yessss,[.4] come to me.[AN]
I'm gonna lay you to sleep[AN]
at the bottom of this[NL]
beautiful swamp.[A]

No![.4] I was meant for[Beat][NL]
so much...[A]

[MidRight][LoadOldwoman]
The archcantor Dolth set up shop[NL]
in a fortress north of here.[AN]
With magic so powerful he can[NL]
resurrect dragons themselves,[AN]
he's warped the terrain and air[NL]
with his evil aura.[AN]
Half the farmers here already moved[NL]
away with the floods last year,[AN]
but Dolth's magic drove out[NL]
the other stragglers.[AN][MoveMidRight]
Oh,[.4] but I'm made of tougher[NL]
stuff than that![AN]
I built this house with my[NL]
own two hands,[.4] I did.[AN]
It'd take an act of Duma himself[NL]
to move me from this spot.[AN]

Curse these bones...[AN][MoveFarLeft]
I can't stand fightin' with[NL]
mud squishin' in my boots![AN]
We need to get out of[NL]
this place yesterday.[AN]
Whaddya say, lass?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, let's...[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadConrad]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
Anthiese, I would speak with you.[AN]
[Left]
Yes, sir knight?[AN]
[FarRight]
Er[Beat] in private,[.4] that is.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Saber,[.4] you're dismissed.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...Keh.[.4] Don't take too long.[AN][ClearFace]
[FarRight]
You have my gratitude.[.4] Shall we?[AN][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[.7]
[FarLeft][LoadSaber]
Hmm.[AN]
[Beat]Nah,[.4] I shouldn't stick my nose[NL]
where it don't belong.[AN]

[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
I think we're sufficiently[NL]
out of earshot.[AN][CloseEyes]
Now,[.4] before I grant you audience--[.4][NL]
tell me,[.4] sir knight.[AN][OpenEyes]
Who are you,[.4] really?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadConrad]
[Beat]
I can tell you no more[NL]
than that I am an ally.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
It's true you've given us aid.[AN]
But I must ask the reason you continue[NL]
to hide your face and your name.[AN]
[MidRight]
Are you so distrustful of me now,[NL]
after all I've done to aid you...?[AN]
To put it simply,[.4] my life is at stake.[NL]
Some very powerful people want me dead.[AN]
I'm sure it's a feeling you understand[NL]
quite well, Anthiese.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I do.[.4] Yet we are alone now.[NL]
Why do you still hesitate?[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you truly wish to save Mila?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
I brought you here to tell you[NL]
what must be done to save her.[AN]
It is for your ears only.[NL]
You must speak of it to no one.[AN]
Do you wish to hear it or not?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Go on.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
To save Mila,[.4] you must first save Duma.[NL]
They are of the same blood.[AN]
Equal and opposite forces shaping our[NL]
world with their unfathomable power.[AN]
Without one to balance the other,[NL]
the earth shall wither and die,[AN]
and our peoples with it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I understand. [Beat]I can already see that[NL]
this land is suffering much like Zofia.[AN]
Has something happened to Duma as well?[AN]
[MidRight]
A life lived over thousands of years[NL]
inevitably ends in decay of the mind.[AN]
Duma has become consumed with desire for[NL]
power to the exclusion of his sanity.[AN]
Soon our prayers will not reach him, and[NL]
if he is lost,[.4] Mila shall soon follow.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
What is this madness?![AN]
Do you truly claim the gods are[NL]
fated to destroy themselves?[AN]
[MidRight]
...I fear so,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
When my master Halcyon was[NL]
High Priest of the Duma Faithful,[AN]
he saw Duma's decline for himself.[AN]
It's a subject we're both,[.4][NL]
unfortunately,[.4] well-versed in.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I[.4] don't want to believe it.[NL]
And yet...[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidRight]
There is hope, though.[.4] At the founding[NL]
of the two kindgoms of Valentia,[AN]
the gods entered a blood pact[NL]
with those chosen as their rulers.[AN]
The proof and the power of this pact[NL]
are passed down as the Brands--[AN]
one of which you yourself bear.[AN]
And now,[.4] as a crowned royal of Zofia,[NL]
you have everything that is needed.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And that is,[.4] exactly?[AN]
[MidRight]
You alone,[.4] Anthiese,[.4] can save the gods[NL]
by returning the blood of their pact.[AN][2NL]
You must offer your life and your soul[NL]
as a sacrifice on Duma's altar.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That[.4] leaves Zofia without a ruler.[AN]
And yet,[.4] without the gods,[NL]
there would be no Zofia at all...[AN]
[MidRight]
Pray think on it for a while.[.4] We've[NL]
time yet until we reach Duma Tower.[AN]
[Beat]Just[.4] bear in mind:[AN][2NL]
You are the only one who can restore[NL]
the order of the gods, Anthiese.[AN]
The choice is in your hands now.[NL]
I trust you will make the right one.[AN][ClearFace]

There you are.[.4] Didn't I[NL]
tell you to keep it brief?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
O-[.4]Oh,[.4] Saber.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The hell happened back there?[NL]
You look pale.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Nothing.[.4] Come.[NL]
We need to hurry.[AN][ClearFace]
