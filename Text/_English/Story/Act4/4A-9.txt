you've got the wrong--[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft][.4][FarRight][LoadMassena][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Welcome home,[.4] Prince Albein.[AN]
I am Massena,[.4] captain of[NL]
Emperor Rudolf's imperial guard.[AN]
His Excellency told me everything[NL]
before facing you in battle.[AN]
Afterward,[.4] I gathered the remnants of[NL]
his forces and awaited your arrival.[AN]
[MidLeft]
He told you[Beat] everything?[AN][MoveMidLeft][LoadAlm]
Are you telling me he knew[NL]
he was going to lose?[AN]
That he expected to die[NL]
by his own son's hand?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I am afraid I cannot speak to[NL]
His Excellency's intentions.[AN]
I humbly ask that you visit the throne[NL]
and listen to what Sir Mycen has to say.[AN]

[MidRight]
So you've come,[.4] Alm.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveLeft][Left]
Grandfather,[.4] what the hell is going on?[NL]
What are you doing here?[AN]
Rudolf said I was his son,[.4] and now all[NL]
these people are calling me a prince![AN]
[MidRight]
It's only natural that you're feeling[NL]
confused.[.4] But there is no denying fact--[AN]
you are the only son of Emperor Rudolf.[AN]
Scion of the Rigelian imperial bloodline,[NL]
and true heir to Rigel's throne.[AN]
[Left][Beat][LoadAlm_Sad]
How could you?[AN]
You knew all this time,[.4] and[NL]
yet you kept it from me...[AN][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveLeft]
You KNEW,[.4] and you still sent me[NL]
off to kill my own father![AN]
[MidRight]
Please remain calm, Alm.[.4] Let me explain.[NL]
...Best I start at the very beginning.[AN]
As you well know,[.4] Valentia has always[NL]
been divided north from south--[.4]split[AN]
between the two gods,[.4] Mila and Duma.[AN]
But their involvement with mankind[NL]
eventually grew too deep.[AN]
When madness takes a god,[.4] man is lost.[NL]
And where gods meet ruin,[.4] men die too.[AN]
That is the plight Valentia now faces.[AN]
[Left][LoadAlm]
You're saying the gods are...[.4] dying?[AN]
[MidRight]
I fear so.[.4] Rudolf was among the[NL]
first to understand the signs.[AN]
He saw Duma's growing madness and[NL]
knew it for a harbinger of ruin.[AN]
But then you were born,[.4] Alm.[AN]
[Left]
What does that have to do[NL]
with any of this?[AN]
[MidRight]
You bore the Brand--[.4]sign of the hero[NL]
who would rise to save Valentia.[AN]
Hearing that prophecy,[.4] Rudolf knew you[NL]
must be kept hidden from the Faithful.[AN]
He concealed the news of your birth,[NL]
and entrusted you to me in Zofia.[AN][CloseEyes]
I will never forget the pain on his face[NL]
when he placed you in my arms...[AN]
[Left]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
That day marked a change in him.[AN]
He donned the mantle of one who would[NL]
destroy the old world order--[AN]
one who'd free men to live by their own[NL]
power,[.4] even if they hated him for it.[AN]
He knew such heresy would bring forth[NL]
those who wished for his death.[AN]
So for that death to come at the hand[NL]
of his beloved son was[Beat] a mercy.[AN]
He told me himself that he could[NL]
imagine no more peaceful end.[AN]
[Left][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveLeft]
And what of my peace?![AN]
[MidRight]
This is not the time for mourning[NL]
or self-pity,[.4] boy.[AN]
Rudolf's purpose now falls to you.[NL]
The true foe you must defeat is Duma.[AN]
As well as the zealots tainted by his[NL]
madness who seek control of Valentia:[AN]
Jedah and his Duma Faithful.[AN]
If you do not hurry,[.4] Celica's life[NL]
will also be in peril.[AN]
[Left][LoadAlm_Sad]
Oh,[.4] gods.[.4][MoveLeft] Celica![AN]
She set out in search of Duma[NL]
in order to save Mila.[AN]
[MidRight]
A passage beneath this castle[NL]
leads to the Temple of Duma.[AN][2NL][.5]
Go,[.4] Alm.[.5] Go and finish this.[AN]
Return the mad god Duma to the[NL]
darkness from whence he came.[AN]
[X]

##Ch4_Alm_EndingText
His whole story was a lie.[NL]
Alm's youth...[.4] his days of[NL]
training with Mycen...[AN]
All were but calculations in a[NL]
far-reaching plot by his[NL]
lord father,[.4] Emperor Rudolf.[AN]
Alm had taken his father's life,[.4] and[NL]
that sadness would stay with him always.[AN]
But destiny would not permit this son[NL]
of the Brand to simply walk away.[AN]
Valentia lay yet in the grip of Duma--[NL]
the wicked god,[.4] the War Father--[AN]
as well as Alm's dear Celica,[.4] who[NL]
would become Duma's willing servant...[A]
