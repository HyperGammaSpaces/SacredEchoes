Alm: ......

Clive: A word, Alm?

Alm: Clive! Did we receive a reply to our petition?

Clive: Unfortunately, no. The empire's silence is likely its answer. I believe it wise to resign ourselves. Emperor Rudolf has no intention of treating for peace. He means to continue his march on Zofian soil.

Alm: Damn...

Clive: Our men are approaching their limit. And Rigel's climate is far colder than what they knew in Zofia. Further delaying here will only sap their strength and morale.

Alm: All right, Clive. I trust your judgment. Let's get ready to march.

Clive: Understood. I'll pass word to the others and prepare them to cross into the empire.

Alm: ...... What's all of this leading to?

Gray: Hey, Alm! I heard the news--guess the time's finally come, eh?

Alm: Yeah. We're headed into Rigel. We'll need to be more careful than ever past this point.

Gray: Hey, careful is my middle name! ...No, really. I had it legally changed. ...Not even a chuckle? Really? Come on, what's with the glowering? We've got this. Hell, I'VE got this! We're not the same scraggly runts we were when we left Ram, you know? I'll forge a new legend in battle! Heh, Clair'll probably throw herself at me. If Tobin comes crying about suddenly wanting to leave, don't get mad, okay?

Alm: Heh heh. That... would be a problem. I need Tobin right where he is. Thanks, Gray. For everything. I'm counting on you.

Gray: â€˜Course. Still, I don't see why the wind here's gotta be so damned cold. Is it really that bad?

Gray: You're not freezing your tenders off? I'm impressed.

Alm: It's not that it doesn't feel cold. It's more like...I know this feeling. Like the air here's familiar.

Gray: Never mind. Come on, let's go.

Lukas: Alm? We're ready to march. According to our intelligence, Rigel's forces await in the forest ahead. General Berkut is commanding them personally.

Alm: Berkut... I guess they're serious about holding the border.

Lukas: Indeed. Yet we've no choice but to cross it.

Alm: ...Right.

Berkut: You kept me waiting, Alm. I was starting to wonder if you'd actually come.

Alm: Berkut!

Berkut: That's quite the little army you've assembled. I'm almost impressed. For a ragtag group of gathered scraps, the Deliverance actually looks the part.

Alm: ......

Berkut: Still, it seems you've all let a few meager successes go to your heads. Who are you to dare threaten Rigel's borders? Lowborn fool. Do you truly fancy yourself the next king of Zofia?! You must learn your place!

Clive: You've got it all wrong, Berkut.

Fernand: Clive?

Clive: I've been at Alm's side from the outset, watching all that he has done. He's a brave warrior, and a good man worthy of the crown. He's made such clear to me time and again. The right of kings is not decided by blood or station. It lies in what a man believes. What keeps him up at night. It lies in a man's actions!

Fernand: E-Enough already! You would throw away your pride as a Zofian noble and bow to a commoner?! I see now that the Clive I once knew is well and truly dead. Now it falls on me to bury him!

Soldier: We're all ready, sir.

Alm: Understood.

Soldier: What is it, sir?

Alm: Sorry. I'm ready.

Alm: Warriors, it's time! Time to defeat Emperor Rudolf, and bring this bloody war to an end! Now then--who will defend Zofia?!

Soldiers: We will defend her!

Alm: Then charge!

Berkut: Nnngh... Damn you.

Alm: You're plenty strong, Berkut. No one would deny that. If you lay down your weapon, I'll let you escape with your life. But if you don't... I won't give you a third chance.

Berkut: Bah! Spare me your treacly platitudes! I was meant for greatness! But you, you're just a...just a... You're worth less than the dirt that cakes your boots!

Fernand: My lord, I have a--

Berkut: --What the devil do YOU want?!

Fernand: ...I have a report. We've taken many casualties. We'd be wise to use this chance to escape.

Berkut: Who do you think you are to give orders to me?! Perhaps you wish to scurry away like the Zofian you are, but I intend to stay and fight. Had YOU not faltered in the face of your former comrade, I would've gotten my rightful victory by now!

Fernand: [Jump] Lord Berkut, I would ask that you LIVE! They offered you mercy. Accept their terms. His Excellency the Emperor will understand.

Berkut: Shut your mouth, Zofian scum! I would rather die here than crawl back to my uncle to beg for mercy. Mercy belongs in the limp wrists of Zofia, not in the clenched fists of Rigelian men where lances instead ought to be!!!

Fernand: Milord, have you taken leave of your senses?!

Berkut: You don't hear it? What was that voice...? So deep as to shake the earth itself... It must be... Yes. The War Father is calling to me.

Fernand: ...Er... of course, milord. Calling you to his temple. So, clearly, we must... we must make haste and return to the capital! Now go, milord! Quickly!

Tobin: They're gone, Alm. Should we go after them?

Alm: No... Pursuing them in our current condition is only asking for further losses.

Berkut: DAMN HIM! Why?! Why can't I beat him?! To be humiliated so by a commoner... And twice, no less!

Rinea: My lord, please! You must try to calm down. You are safe. That's all I need to be--

Berkut: Silence, woman! What could you possibly know?!

Rinea: *gasp* Berkut...

Berkut: From childhood, all that's ever been asked of me is strength. It is my duty as one born to stand above others. To rule. I've been taught that all my life. By my father, my mother... How am I to remain calm in the face of defeat at the hands of peasants?!

Rinea: Berkut? You're frightening me... I-I can brew you some tea if you'd--

Berkut: I said SILENCE! The only comfort I need is more power! The War Father has chosen me, and me alone. I will go and pray to him, and it is through His power I will crush that uppity farm-boy myself!!
[ClearFace]

Rinea: ...

Fernand: ...

Rinea: Sir Fernand... You didn't hear that, did you...?

Fernand: ...My apologies. I've been keeping close watch on him since he started acting strange at the border.

Rinea: I... I assure you. He's not normally like this.

Fernand: He shouted at me the same way.

Rinea: I'm so sorry... He doesn't mean it, I'm sure--

Fernand: I've been thinking a lot on something... a very dear friend said to me. That a man's actions and convictions are just as important as his bloodline. I'd certainly never debase myself to follow a commoner, but... 

Rinea: Sir Fernand?

Fernand: ...No, it's nothing. I daren't speak ill of our lord. But...if you have need of a sympathetic ear, mine are open to you. ...I'll take my leave now.

Rinea: ...Oh, Berkut...

##Ch4A_2_OpeningText
Alm: Where do these woods lead, exactly?

Clive: To Fear Mountain. Home to Nuibaba of the Duma Faithful. Most would cross the Rigel Plains to the west to reach the imperial palace, so there's no NEED to take this route, should we wish for safer passage...

Lukas: I propose that we advance regardless.

Alm: Why is that, Lukas?

Lukas: I've heard grim reports of this arcanist Nuibaba. She's of a kind with General Jerome, who controls the Rigel Plains. They're tyrants both, and their subjects suffer terribly under their yoke. But if a pack of good-hearted invaders such as us were to take them out? Well, we might find ourselves with new support among the Rigelian masses...

Alm: Interesting...

Lukas: Granted, we run the risk of losing men we can't afford to be without, so I'm not insisting we do this. I only offer the suggestion.

Alm: I'll think on it, Lukas. Thank you.

Alm: This is going to sound crazy, but I thought I heard...Celica.

Clive: Celica? The priestess girl from the castle? I'm sorry to say, I heard nothing...

Celica: Alm... I need you, Alm...

Alm: It IS her! Where are you, Celica?!

Clive: Huh? What's... Alm, wait!

Alm: Celica! Where are you, Celica?!

Celica: Alm... I'm so glad you've come...

Alm: Celica?! What is this...? An illusion?

Celica: Yes... Alm, I'm being held prisoner in Nuibaba's abode.

Alm: What? Are you hurt?!

Celica: Help me, Alm... I have faith... I know you'll come... I'm waiting for you... I've always been waiting...

Alm: Wait! Celica, don't go! Dammit! Was that really her?
