I've heard it said a curious power[NL]
is at work in these woods.[AN]
And that the trees themselves conspire[NL]
to hide the path to the hamlet.[AN]
I'm grateful we have you[NL]
to lead the way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er,[.4] right.[.5] The exit lies[NL]
to the northeast of here.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
In truth,[.4] I have left this boscage[NL]
only once before.[.5] Alack,[.4] I fear my[AN]
knowledge of how to return through it[NL]
is[Beat] far from expert.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] see.[NL]
...Shall we get started,[.4] then?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Er,[.4] Sage Halcyon?[.5] Sir?[.4] I'm--[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah![.4] Celica,[.4] child of fate.[NL]
I'm glad you've come.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Child of fate...[.4] You're not[NL]
the first to call me that.[AN]
But I have such doubts as to[NL]
where my fate lies.[AN]
My faith has seen me this far,[.4] but I[NL]
haven't heard Mila's voice in so long.[AN]
[Beat]Please,[.4] Halcyon.[.5] Grant me guidance.[NL]
Tell me what fate holds for me.[AN]
[MidRight]
I know you have suffered much[NL]
along the path here, Celica.[AN]
But I fear I ken no more of[NL]
anyone's fate than you do.[AN]
What I do ken,[.4] however,[.4] is this:[NL]
Two things exist to guide you.[AN]
One is the Brand you bear.[AN]
The other is your soul's pair[NL]
with the selfsame mark.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The selfsame...[NL]
Do you mean Alm?[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed.[.4] Why were you[NL]
born with the Brand?[AN]
And why are there two of you?[AN]
These are the questions[NL]
you must consider.[AN]
And always remember that[NL]
you are not alone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Right.[.4] Thank you,[NL]
Sage Halcyon.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course,[.4] child.[AN]
But while I cannot read the future,[NL]
my magic may yet assist you.[AN]
If there is anything[NL]
you wish for,[.4] tell me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I...[.4] I wish nothing for myself.[NL]
But I am worried for Alm.[AN]
Please,[.4] if such a thing is possible,[NL]
use your powers to help him.[AN]
[MidRight]
The other child of fate?[NL]
Yours is a generous heart.[AN]
Very well...[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah![.4] What just happened?[AN]
[MidRight]
I sent my powers on to Alm.[AN]
With them,[.4] he will be able to[NL]
draw on new strength beyond himself.[AN]
He need only will for it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
Oh,[.4] thank you,[.4] Halcyon![AN]

Tell me,[.4] Celica.[NL]
Do you wish to see Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[.5] Well,[.4] of course I do,[.4] but...[NL]
I doubt Alm is eager to see me.[AN]
I said terrible things to him[NL]
when we last parted.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh heh.[.4] The fire of youth at work.[AN]
All the more reason to meet[NL]
and speak again,[.4] no?[AN]
I can send you to him if you desire it.[AN]
Not your physical form,[.4] but[NL]
a projection of your mind.[AN]
Enough to speak,[.4] at least.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Is that really possible?[AN]
[MidRight]
It is.[.5] Close your eyes,[.4] child.[AN]

Alm...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmm?[.4] I heard my name...[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Alm,[.4] it's me.[.5] It's Celica![AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica?[.4] How are you here?[NL]
Actually,[.4] where are you?[AN]
Come out already![AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight][LoadCelica_Promoted][ToggleSmile]
Alm![.4] I can't believe I[NL]
actually have this chance...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Celica![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
Is this[Beat] just an illusion?[NL]
Is it really you?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveRight][Right]
Yes,[.4] it's me.[.5] Sage Halcyon's magic[NL]
is allowing me to speak with you.[AN][MoveRight]
Oh,[.4] I've missed you so much![AN]
[Left]
I'm happy to see you,[.4] too.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Alm,[.4] listen,[.4] I[Beat] [CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Whoa,[.4] what's wrong?[NL]
[Beat]Celica?[.5] Did something happen?[AN]
Are things not going as[NL]
well as you'd hoped?[AN][MoveLeft]
Augh,[.4] I wish you were here in person![NL]
I don't know what to...[AN]
[Beat]Please don't cry.[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
Y-[.4]You're not angry?[AN]
I said such terrible things[NL]
to you back at the castle.[AN]
[Left]
Huh?[.4] Wait,[.4] that's been bothering you?[AN]
I mean,[.4] sure,[.4] I was sad you didn't[NL]
seem to see my side of things.[AN]
But I'd never get mad at you.[AN]
[Right]
Why not?[AN]
[Left]
...Why not?[.4] You sure do like[NL]
putting me on the spot.[AN]
Didn't we have a similar[NL]
conversation years ago?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Ha![.4] I...[.4] I suppose we did.[NL]
You were always so nice to me,[.4] while I--[AN]
While I'm always inside my own head,[NL]
without heed for any burdens but my own.[AN]
I'm sorry,[.4] Alm.[.5] I've been so selfish.[AN]
But there's no room for selfishness[NL]
along the path I now must walk.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Celica,[.4] wait.[NL]
I finally figured it out.[.4] You're...[AN]
You're the princess of Zofia,[NL]
aren't you?[.5] Princess Anthiese.[AN]
[Right]
...I am.[.4] Heh.[.4] I guess my secret's out.[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
Ugh,[.4] now I'm cringing at[NL]
what I said to you before.[AN]
Talk about thoughtless![NL][OpenEyes]
Forgive me,[.4] Celica.[AN]
I'll make it up to you by getting[NL]
you your kingdom back.[.5] I promise.[AN]
[Right]
It's kind of you,[.4] Alm.[NL]
And I wish you the best, [.4]truly.[AN][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow]
[Right][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
But winning this war isn't enough[NL]
to deliver Zofia from catastrophe.[AN]
[Left]
What?[.4] I don't understand.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mila wasn't in her temple, Alm.[AN]
[Left]
Huh?[.4] What does that mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
The Divine Accord was broken.[AN]
Emperor Rudolf attacked the Temple,[NL]
and imprisoned her in Duma Tower.[AN]
The Earth Mother's absence is why[NL]
Zofia's soil has gone barren.[AN]
So...[.4] I'm going to rescue her.[NL]
She's our only hope.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
You're going to Duma Tower?[AN]
Celica,[.4] the Duma Faithful are--[NL]
It's--[.4][MoveLeft]It's too dangerous![AN]
There's no telling what[NL]
they'll do to you![AN]
[MidRight]
Even so...[.4] I have to go.[NL]
[Beat]I'm sorry, Alm.[AN]
I'm well aware this might be[NL]
the last time I get to see you.[AN]
But this is what the gods[NL]
have willed for me.[AN]
I have to save Mila.[NL]
I'm the only one who can.[AN]
[Left]
No...[.4] Please![NL]
Why does it have to be you?![AN]
Why is there always something waiting[NL]
to rip you away from the people who[AN]
care for you the most?![.4][MoveLeft] It isn't fair![AN]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][FarRight]
It'll be clear to you soon.[NL]
I'll do everything I can here.[AN]
Please just[Beat] be safe.[AN][ClearFace]
