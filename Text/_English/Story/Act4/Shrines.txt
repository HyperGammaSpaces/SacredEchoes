I've heard it said a curious power[NL]
is at work in these woods.[AN]
And that the trees themselves conspire[NL]
to hide the path to the hamlet.[AN]
I'm grateful we have you[NL]
to lead the way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er, right.[.4] The exit lies[NL]
to the northeast of here.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
There is no direct path through,[AN]
however--[.4]the [Red]magic circles[Red] are[NL]
the only way to reach the entrance.[AN]
And[Beat] well, this is my first[NL]
time leaving the hamlet,[AN]
so I'm not exactly sure[NL]
how to[Beat] you know. Get back?[AN][MoveMidRight]
But hey, adventure![AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-[.4]yes, adventure.[NL]
...Shall we get started, then?[AN]

Er, Sage Halcyon? Sir? I'm--[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah! Celica, child of fate.[NL]
I'm glad you've come.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Child of fate... You're not[NL]
the first to call me that.[AN]
But I have such doubts as to[NL]
where my fate lies.[AN]
My faith has seen me this far, but I[NL]
haven't heard Mila's voice in so long.[AN]
[Beat]Please, Halcyon. Grant me guidance.[NL]
Tell me what fate holds for me.[AN]
[MidRight]
I know you have suffered much[NL]
along the path here, Celica.[AN]
But I fear I ken no more of[NL]
anyone's fate than you do.[AN]
What I do ken, however, is this:[NL]
Two things exist to guide you.[AN]
One is the Brand you bear.[AN]
The other is your soul's pair[NL]
with the selfsame mark.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The selfsame...[NL]
Do you mean Alm?[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed. Why were you[NL]
born with the Brand?[AN]
And why are there two of you?[AN]
These are the questions[NL]
you must consider.[AN]
And always remember that[NL]
you are not alone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Right. Thank you,[NL]
Sage Halcyon.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course, child.[AN]
But while I cannot read the future,[NL]
my magic may yet assist you.[AN]
If there is anything[NL]
you wish for, tell me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I...[.4] I wish nothing for myself.[NL]
But I am worried for Alm.[AN]
Please, if such a thing is possible,[NL]
use your powers to help him.[AN]
[MidRight]
The other child of fate?[NL]
Yours is a generous heart.[AN]
Very well...[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah! What just happened?[AN]
[MidRight]
I sent my powers on to Alm.[AN]
With them, he will be able to[NL]
draw on new strength beyond himself.[AN]
He need only will for it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
Oh, thank you, Halcyon![AN]

Tell me, Celica.[NL]
Do you wish to see Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What? Well, of course I do, but...[NL]
I doubt Alm is eager to see me.[AN]
I said terrible things to him[NL]
when we last parted.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh heh. The fire of youth at work.[AN]
All the more reason to meet[NL]
and speak again, no?[AN]
I can send you to him if you desire it.[AN]
Not your physical form, but[NL]
a projection of your mind.[AN]
Enough to speak, at least.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Is that really possible?[AN]
[MidRight]
It is.[.4] Close your eyes, child.[AN]

Alm...[AN]

Hmm?[.4] I heard my name...[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Alm, it's me.[.4] It's Celica![AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica? How are you here?[NL]
Actually, where are you?[AN]
Come out already![AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight][LoadCelica_Promoted][ToggleSmile]
Alm! I can't believe I[NL]
actually have this chance...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Celica![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
Is this[Beat] just an illusion?[NL]
Is it really you?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveRight][Right]
Yes, it's me. Sage Halcyon's magic[NL]
is allowing me to speak with you.[AN][MoveRight]
Oh, I've missed you so much![AN]
[Left]
I'm happy to see you, too.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Alm, listen, I[Beat] [CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Whoa, what's wrong?[NL]
[Beat]Celica? Did something happen?[AN]
Are things not going as[NL]
well as you'd hoped?[AN][MoveLeft]
Augh, I wish you were here in person![NL]
I don't know what to...[AN]
[Beat]Please don't cry.[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
Y-[.4]you're not angry?[AN]
I said such terrible things[NL]
to you back at the castle.[AN]
[Left]
Huh? Wait, that's been bothering you?[AN]
I mean, sure, I was sad you didn't[NL]
seem to see my side of things.[AN]
But I'd never get mad at you.[AN]
[Right]
Why not?[AN]
[Left]
...Why not? You sure do like[NL]
putting me on the spot.[AN]
Didn't we have a similar[NL]
conversation years ago?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Ha! I... I suppose we did.[NL]
You were always so nice to me, while I--[AN]
While I'm always inside my own head,[NL]
with my own burdens.[AN]
[Left]
Wait, Celica...[NL]
I finally figured it out.[AN]
You're the princess of Zofia,[NL]
aren't you?[.5] Princess Anthiese.[AN]
[Right]
...I am. Heh. I guess my secret's out.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Ugh, now I'm cringing at[NL]
what I said to you before.[AN]
Talk about thoughtless![NL]
Forgive me, Celica.[AN]
But don't worry--[.4]I promise[NL]
I'll get your kingdom back.[AN]
[Right]
It's kind of you, Alm.[NL]
And I wish you the best, truly.[AN][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow]
[Right][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
But just winning this war isn't enough.[AN]
[Left]
What? I don't understand.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mila wasn't in her temple, Alm.[AN]
[Left]
Huh? What does that mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
The Divine Accord was broken, and[NL]
she's being held captive in Duma Tower.[AN]
It's why the land in Zofia has gone[NL]
barren. War alone won't fix that.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
You're going to Duma Tower? Celica,[NL]
the Duma Faithful are a cult of madmen![AN]
They sacrifice human life[NL]
to their cruel god.[AN]
What if they do that to you?![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'm sorry, Alm.[AN]
I'm well aware this might be[NL]
the last time I get to see you.[AN]
But this is what the gods[NL]
have willed for me:[AN]
I have to free Mila.[NL]
I'm the only one who can.[AN]
[Left]
Why...[.4] Why does it have to be you?[NL]
Why is there always something[AN]
pulling you away from the people[NL]
who care about you?![.4][MoveLeft] It isn't fair![AN]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][FarRight]
It'll be clear to you soon.[NL]
I'll do everything I can here.[AN]
Please just[Beat] be safe.[AN][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Promoted]
The tower is massive[Beat] Oppressive.[NL]
Like Duma's power given form.[AN]
What lies beyond the quest[NL]
for ever-greater power?[AN]
The key sealing Mila away[NL]
lies with Jedah.[AN]
Whether by bargain or by force,[NL]
we must take it for ourselves.[AN]

Impressive. I did not expect all of you to make it here.
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Enough talk. I will see Mila now. Release her from her cell. I know you hold the key.
[MidRight]
Keh heh heh. As you wish. It is yours. Mila, and Lord Duma's altar, lie behind these doors.

[MidRight][LoadJedah]
It is indeed the divine blade. Wielded by Emperor Rudolf himself to slay her. I trust you will forgive me for glossing over this particular detail.
[MidLeft]
...You're no disciple of the gods. You're a faithless monster.
[MidRight]
Ah, but I needed you here, Your Highness! For there is only one living being in whose veins Mila's blood still flows--a Zofian royal bearing the brand of the blood pact. Had I extinguished your hope with the truth too early, you'd have slain me and left Lord Duma to rot. And Valentia to rot without its gods!
[MidLeft]
Give me one reason why I shouldn't do it now.
[MidRight]
If you wish to save your precious Mila, you must trade your life for hers.
