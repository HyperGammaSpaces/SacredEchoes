This fortress is the last thing[NL]
standing between us and Rigel Castle.[AN]
Good news for us,[.4] but to them,[NL]
it's their last line of defense.[AN]
And men always fight hardest when[NL]
their backs are to the wall.[AN]
Let's take every precaution we can.[AN]
[Left]
Right.[.4] We only get one chance.[NL]
We'll make it count.[AN]

Bwa ha ha ha ha![.4] Marvelous![AN]
Welcome,[.4] ladies and gentlemen[NL]
of the Deliverance![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft]
Slayde?![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Indeed![.4] And I am dearly glad[NL]
to see you again,[.4] boy.[AN]
You really are full of surprises.[AN]
To think a mere farmboy like you would[NL]
become leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
Or that you would now stand poised[NL]
to claim the Rigelian Empire as well![AN]
It's the stuff of legends,[.4] this is.[NL][MoveMidRight]
Simply astonishing![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Why are you here?[.4] Last I checked,[NL]
you served Desaix.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
True[Beat] but that was in a former life,[NL]
when I was still a knight of Zofia.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
What?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You lot ran me out of the castle thanks[NL]
to that clod Desaix's incompetence.[AN]
So[Beat] I defected to Rigel![AN]
Quisling or no,[.4] they paid good coin[NL]
for a noble's intelligence on the enemy.[AN][MoveMidRight]
They were SO grateful,[.4] in fact,[.4] they[NL]
appointed me to captain this fortress![AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft]
You lack even a modicum of shame![AN]
How dare you call yourself a noble[NL]
after trading away your pride![AN]
[MidRight]
Pride?[.4] [MoveMidRight]Ha![.4] Pride has never filled a[NL]
man's belly or warmed him in the snow.[AN]
And while we're speaking,[.4] Clive,[NL]
let me tell you this:[AN][2NL]
I've always despised you.[AN][MoveMidRight]
You and your pathetic platitudes![NL]
Pride this...[.4] Honor that...[AN]
Only a naif believes that righteousness[NL]
will keep a man drawing breath![AN]
[Left]
Which of us is truly naive,[.4] Slayde?[AN]
You're focused on naught but survival,[NL]
yet[Beat] survival to what end?[AN]
With no core belief to steel your spine,[NL]
you turn tail at every shadow.[AN]
Men broken by life's unfairness who cast[NL]
all principle aside will never triumph.[AN]
You,[.4] Slayde,[.4] will never know victory.[NL]
We will NOT lose to the likes of you.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Clive...[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Nrgh...[.4] Silence...[.4][MoveMidRight] SILENCE![AN]
This is merely the desperate barking[NL]
of a cur faced down by a lion![AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][.6][MoveMidRight]
Well?![.4] Don't stand there![.4] Attack![NL]
Defend your captain's honor!![AN]
Paint the halls red with Zofian blood![AN]
Silence their lies,[.4] even if it means[NL]
cutting the tongues from their mouths![AN]

You![.4] Fernand![.4] Did you[NL]
not hear my orders?![AN]
I AM your captain here,[.4] and[AN]
our new fatherland does not[NL]
take kindly to disobedience![AN]
[MidRight]
Whichever palms you've greased to[NL]
[0x93]earn[0x93] your rank,[.4] Slayde,[AN]
I'll take no orders from a man whose[NL]
pride can be bought for coin.[AN]
It's an absolute disgrace that[NL]
noble blood ever flowed through[AN]
the sewers you call veins.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Grr...![.4] I should've known a turncoat[NL]
like you would turn again.[AN][MoveFarLeft]
It's that blasted Clive,[.4] isn't it?![AN]
The moment your little gentleman-friend[NL]
says something against ME,[.4] you fall[AN]
all over yourself to kiss his boots[NL]
as if you'd never deserted him at all![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Don't dare bring Clive into this,[NL]
you snivelling lamprey![AN]
His name doesn't deserve the dishonor[NL]
of being spat from your filthy maw.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha![.4] As I thought![.4] Do you truly believe[NL]
he would welcome you back so blithely,[AN]
if you would only throw yourself weeping[NL]
at his feet like a jilted mistress?![AN][ToggleSmile]
If I don't see you out there slaying him[NL]
in the name of Rigel within the hour,[AN]
I'll have you executed for treason--[NL]
am I clear?![AN][LoadOverworldFaces][.6]
[MidRight]
What a farce![.4] I'd sooner turn[NL]
my lance on you than him.[AN]
In fact,[.4] I'd relish a proper chance to--[AN]

...Sir Fernand?[AN]

Whew...[.4] I guess that's the[NL]
last we'll see of Slayde,[.4] huh?[AN]
[Right]
Indeed.[.4] And it is a joy[NL]
to finally be rid of him.[AN]
Personal history aside,[AN]
it's brought me some closure[NL]
on the Desaix affair.[AN]
[FarRight]
With the last of Desaix's[NL]

I would say that the Deliverance[NL]
has achieved its original purpose.[AN]

There you have it--[.4]straight from[NL]

Today's victory is worth celebrating.[NL]
But as for me[Beat][AN]
I won't consider the Deliverance's[NL]
work done until all of Valentia[AN]

[FarRight]
You needn't even ask.[.4] Our mission has[NL]
long since grown beyond Zofia's borders.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.5]

Rigel Castle is within sight.[AN]
Soon,[.4] this grueling war will be over.[AN]
Soon,[.4] Rudolf's tyranny over this land[NL]

Soon,[.4] Zofia will be safe,[NL]
and Rigel will be free.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
I refuse to accept a world that[NL]
allows the strong to run roughshod[AN]
over innocent people as their right![NL]
That is why I continue to fight.[AN]
And so[Beat] for one last time,[AN]
I hope you'll fight alongside me[NL]
in the name of the Deliverance![AN]
