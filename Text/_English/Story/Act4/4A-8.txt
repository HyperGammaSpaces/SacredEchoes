This fortress is the last thing[NL]
standing between us and Rigel Castle.[AN]
Good news for us,[.4] but to them,[NL]
it's their last line of defense.[AN]
And men always fight hardest when[NL]
their backs are to the wall.[AN]
Let's take every precaution we can.[AN]
[Left]
Right.[.4] We only get one chance.[NL]
We'll make it count.[AN]

[.4][MidRight][LoadSlayde][ToggleSmile]
Bwa ha ha ha ha![.4] Marvelous![AN]
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen[NL]
of the Deliverance![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft]
Slayde?![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Indeed![.4] And I am dearly glad[NL]
to see you again, boy.[AN]
You really are full of surprises.[AN]
To think a mere farmboy like you would[NL]
become leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
Or that you would now stand poised[NL]
to claim the Rigelian Empire as well![AN]
It's the stuff of legends, this is.[NL][MoveMidRight]
Simply astonishing![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Why are you here?[.4] Last I checked,[NL]
you served Desaix.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
True[Beat] but that was in a former life,[NL]
when I was still a knight of Zofia.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
What?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You lot ran me out of the castle thanks[NL]
to that clod Desaix's incompetence.[AN]
So[Beat] I defected to Rigel![AN]
Turncoat or no, they paid good coin[NL]
for a noble's intelligence on the enemy.[AN][MoveMidRight]
They were SO grateful, in fact, they[NL]
appointed me to captain this fortress![AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft]
You lack even a modicum of shame![AN]
How dare you call yourself a noble[NL]
after trading away your pride![AN]
[MidRight]
Pride?[.4] [MoveMidRight]Ha![.4] Pride has never filled a[NL]
man's belly or warmed him in the snow.[AN]
And while we're speaking, Clive,[NL]
let me tell you this:[AN]
I've always despised you.[AN]
You and your pathetic platitudes![NL]
Pride this... Honor that...[AN]
Only a naif believes that righteousness[NL]
will keep a man drawing breath![AN]
[Left]
Which of us is truly naive, Slayde?[AN]
You're focused on naught but survival,[NL]
yet... survival to what end?[AN]
With no core belief to steel your spine,[NL]
you turn tail at every shadow.[AN]
Men broken by life's unfairness who cast[NL]
all principle aside will never triumph.[AN]
You, Slayde, will never know victory.[NL]
We will NOT lose to the likes of you.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Clive...[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Nrgh...[.4] Silence...[.4][MoveMidRight] SILENCE![AN]
This is merely the desperate barking[NL]
of a cur faced down by a lion![AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][.6][MoveMidRight]
Well?! Don't stand there! Attack![NL]
Defend your captain's honor!![AN]

[MidRight][LoadFernand][.4]
[FarLeft][LoadSlayde][MoveFarLeft]
You! Fernand! Did you[NL]
not hear my orders?![AN]
I AM your captain here, and[AN]
our new fatherland does not[NL]
take kindly to disobedience![AN]
[MidRight]
Whatever rank you've boot-licked[NL]
yourself into, Slayde,[AN]
I'll take no orders from a man whose[NL]
pride can be bought for coin.[AN]
It's an absolute disgrace that[NL]
noble blood ever flowed through[AN]
the sewers you call veins.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Grr...! I should've known a turncoat[NL]
like you would turn again.[AN][MoveFarLeft]
It's that blasted Clive, isn't it?![AN]
The moment your little gentleman-friend[NL]
says something against ME, you fall[AN]
all over yourself to kiss his feet[NL]
as if you'd never deserted him at all![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Don't dare bring Clive into this,[NL]
you snivelling lamprey![AN]
His name doesn't deserve the dishonor[NL]
of being spat from your filthy maw.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You poltroon![AN][MoveFarLeft]
You're considering deserting and begging[NL]
Clive to take you back, aren't you?![AN]
If I don't see you out there slaying him[NL]
in the name of Rigel within the hour,[AN]
I'll have you executed for treason--[NL]
am I clear?![AN]
[MidRight]
What a farce![.4] I'd sooner turn[NL]
my lance on you than him.[AN]
In fact, I'd relish a proper chance to--[AN]
[FarRight][LoadRinea]
...Sir Fernand?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
L-Lady Rinea![AN]
[FarRight]
A moment, please?[NL]
Lord Berkut requests your audience.[AN]
[Right]
...Does he?[.4] Very well.[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace][Right][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
Worthless piece of...[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
True soldiers of Rigel![NL]
Paint the halls red with Zofian blood![AN]
Silence their lies, even if it means[NL]
cutting the tongues from their mouths![AN]
