I've returned from surveillance duty.[AN]
The forest here is too overgrown[NL]
to allow me to see much at all,[AN]
but there is a Rigelian fortification[NL]
atop the cliff to the north.[AN]
It's too dark to glean their composition,[NL]
but their numbers appear to be few.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Right.[.5] Thank you,[.4] Clair.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Alm?[.4] You seem unusually pensive.[NL]
Might I ask you to share your thoughts?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Sorry.[.5] It's just...[AN]
Well,[.4] it's finally starting to sink in[NL]
that we're invading another country.[AN]
In Zofia,[.4] the cheers of the common people[NL]
as we toppled Desaix and pushed back[AN]
the Rigelian invasion kept our spirits[NL]
high even in the toughest battles.[AN]
But here,[.4] we're just the bad guys.[AN]
I mean,[.4] I understand why,[.4] but...[NL]
it still doesn't feel great.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] Alm[Beat] I know that feeling well.[AN]
My training with the Knights of Zofia[NL]
didn't prepare me for coming this far.[AN]
The idea of actually going to war in[NL]
Rigel sounded far-fetched at best.[AN]
Now it's as if I've suddenly been[NL]
thrown headfirst into an icy lake[AN]
of cold weather and colder stares.[AN]
I can't imagine how much heavier[NL]
it weighs on you as commander...[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No matter how it makes me feel,[NL]
I intend to keep going.[AN]
We have a duty to Zofia to uphold.[NL]
Don't worry about me,[.4] Clair.[AN]
I'm not about to disappoint you[NL]
or anyone else in the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hee hee.[.4] Now there's the Alm[NL]
I'm used to hearing.[AN]
Let us both remember that we ARE still[NL]
heroes to those who matter most to us.[AN]
I have faith in you,[.4] Alm,[.4] and I know[NL]
Clive and the others feel the same.[AN]
So hold your head high and let not[NL]
the words of the Rigelians dwell in it![AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[.4] Thanks,[.4] Clair.[NL]
I really needed that.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][.4]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Still...[AN][CloseEyes]
I can't shake this weird feeling.[NL]
It shouldn't be bothering me this much.[AN]

Finally,[.4] a clearing...[NL]
We're close.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Listen.[.4] Do you hear that?[NL]
Near-total silence.[AN]
Even the crickets have stopped[NL]
for fear of what might hunt them.[AN]
It's a sign that whoever mans this[NL]
fort is well-prepared for our arrival.[AN]
In any other circumstance,[NL]
a midnight ambush like this[AN]
would give us crucial advantage....[AN]
But we must be on our guard for[NL]
what may lurk in these shadows.[AN]

...This silence leaves me uneasy.[AN]
A fort like this would surely be manned,[NL]
yet all its torches have been doused.[AN]
They may be expecting an ambush...[NL]
or worse,[.4] planning their own.[AN]
We must be on our guard for[NL]

What in the world are you people[NL]
doing out here at this hour?[AN]
Only the soldiers should be awake,[.4] and[NL]
you don't wear the armor of Rigel...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Then you're...[.4] invaders!![NL]
In the name of Duma,[.4] I cast thee OUT![AN][ClearFace]

Ow![.4] Hey![AN]

A branch,[.4] snapping in the distance.[AN]
That's the signal:[NL]
our target approaches.[AN]
Soldiers,[.4] man the fort.[NL]
I'll face him myself.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.6][CloseEyes]
It is almost a shame I must slay[NL]
such an opponent as that boy...[AN]

Where do these woods lead,[.4] exactly?[AN]
[Right]
To Fear Mountain. Home to[NL]
Nuibaba of the Duma Faithful.[AN]
Most would cross the Rigel Plains to[NL]
the west to reach the imperial palace,[AN]
so there's no NEED to take this route,[NL]
should we wish for safer passage...[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLukas]
I propose that we advance regardless.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why is that,[.4] Lukas?[AN]
[FarRight]
I've heard grim reports of this Nuibaba.[AN]
She's of a kind with General Jerome,[NL]
who controls the Rigel Plains.[AN]
They're tyrants both,[.4] and their subjects[NL]
suffer terribly under their yoke.[AN]
But if a pack of good-hearted invaders[NL]
such as us were to take them out?[AN]
Well,[.4] we might find ourselves with new[NL]
support among the Rigelian masses...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Interesting...[AN]
[FarRight]
Granted,[.4] we run the risk of losing men[NL]
we can't afford to be without,[AN]
so I'm not insisting we do this.[NL]
I only offer the suggestion.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Actually,[.4] I've been thinking...[AN]
Maybe it would be a good idea to[NL]
take a chance on something like this.[AN]
It's a sound strategy to try and[NL]
foster goodwill among the people here.[AN]
They may not trust us,[.4] but they're not[NL]
our enemies.[.5] Let's prove that to them.
[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Well said,[.4] Alm.[NL]
I'll inform the others.[AN][ToggleSmile][ClearFace]
[Right][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Somehow,[.4] I feel... like[NL]
someone is watching over me.[AN]
Maybe that's what was making me[NL]

I want to make you proud.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

That man...[.4] Xaizor,[.4] was it?[AN]
His skill with the blade was terrifying,[NL]
but he didn't seem like a bad person.[AN]
[Beat]I wish there'd been some way for[NL]
him to make it out of this alive.[AN]
[MidRight]
...We can certainly dream.[AN]
I doubt Berkut's refusal to retreat[NL]
is a principle shared by the entire[AN]
ranks of the Rigelian army.[AN]
I'd like to think even the most honor-[NL]
driven warrior would accept mercy,[AN]
if it was given in good faith.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I hope you're right.[AN][OpenEyes]
Berkut's reaction seemed pretty over[NL]
the top,[.4] but I guess he IS the heir.[AN]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Those must be some pretty[NL]
darn big boots to fill.[AN]

Ahaha.[.4] That much is certain.[AN]

your skill, warrior to warrior.[AN]
[Right]
O-[.4]Oh.[.4] Um,[.4] thanks?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I won't offer you false hope.[NL]
The Emperor's orders are absolute,[AN]
and I've no intention of aiding[NL]
your cause against him.[AN]
But my instincts as a warrior[NL]
push me to see just how far[AN]
a worthy opponent like you can go.[NL]
Allow me to leave you with this gift.[AN]
[Right]
I'll consider it an honor,[NL]
then.[.4] Thank you.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Right]
[Beat]Uh,[.4] bye?[AN]

That was certainly...[.4] odd.[AN]
But it does seem to be[NL]
a gift in good faith.[AN][2NL]
We might as well make use of this.[AN]
