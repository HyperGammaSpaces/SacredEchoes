[FarRight]
Um,[.4] Celica...?[NL]
I don't want to bother you,[.4] but...[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh,[.4] Genny,[.4] you aren't being a bother.[NL]
What do you need?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
I just can't help it...[NL]
I'm ever so curious.[AN]
You seemed so preoccupied after[NL]
speaking with that masked knight.[AN]
What were you talking about?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Th-[.4][MoveMidLeft]That?[.4] Um,[.4] nothing.[NL]
That is,[.4] nothing you need to worry about.[AN]
There's a lot more responsibility to being[NL]
a princess once you've put on the crown.[AN]
That's all this is.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Of course I know being a princess isn't[NL]
all pretty dresses and handsome suitors![AN]
But,[.4] you know[Beat] I was wondering[NL]
if you'd figured anything out about[AN]
who that knight really is.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You know[Beat] I bet he's really handsome[NL]
under that mask.[.4][MoveMidRight] Hee hee...[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]
...Oh,[.4] please,[.4] Genny.[AN][OpenEyes]
We were discussing official business--[.4][NL]
and a serious matter,[.4] at that.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You're not curious about him[NL]
at all...?[.6] [MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh![.4] I get it.[AN]
You're holding out for that boy you[NL]
met at the castle,[.4] aren't you?[AN]
Long-lost childhood friends,[NL]
pining for each other from afar...[AN]
and one was a secret princess all along![NL][MoveMidRight]
Ooh,[.4] it's so perfectly romantic...[AN]
I hope you'll go and see him[NL]
when we go back to the castle![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Th-[.4][MoveMidLeft]That's quite enough,[.4] Genny! [.4][NL][CloseEyes]*sigh*[Beat][AN]
Knowing you,[.4] you're already thinking of[NL]
writing a story about this,[.4] aren't you...[AN][OpenEyes]
Unfortunately,[.4] we have a difficult[NL]
journey ahead of us,[.4] and we must[AN]
train our focus on surviving it.[AN]
I'll be happy to read what you're writing[NL]
after this journey's end.[.4][ToggleSmile] Fair deal?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Aww...[.4] I understand.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I guess that means I'll have to[NL]
try extra hard out there,[.4] then![AN]
[X]

What's this?[.4] Another graveyard?[.4][NL]
[CloseEyes]...Of course it is.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ugh,[.4] seriously?[.4] How are you[NL]
not used to this by now?[AN]
If you've seen one ghoul-ridden[NL]
deathscape,[.4] you've seen 'em all![AN]
[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
I suppose you have[Beat][OpenEyes] something[NL]
of a point.[.4] Fine.[.4] Let's press on.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Actually,[.4] looks like this place is[NL]
full of necrodragons.[.4] So that's new![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Eeeyaaaaugh![AN]
[X]

## Ch4C_2_EndingText
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Promoted][.6]
Those dragons,[.4] rotting and mad...[AN]
Could they once have been kin[NL]
to the likes of Duma and Mila?[AN]
Is this the same fate that has befallen[NL]
Duma...[.4] and that awaits Mila as well?[AN]
Even in light of the inestimable[NL]
power of a divine dragon...[AN]
when that power is given freely to[NL]
support generations upon generations[AN]
of humans over countless centuries...[AN]
Perhaps it isn't impossible that it[NL]
might take some kind of toll on them.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]
[HalfCloseEyes][Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4][CloseEyes]
Mother Mila,[.4] thou who hast given so[NL]
freely of thyself to shelter our kind[AN]
from toil and thowel:[AN]
forgive thy servant her blindness to[NL]
the cost of thy selfless sacrifices.[AN][2NL]
Mother Mila,[.4] whose vengeance takes[NL]
upon those who profane thy soil[AN]
with blood wrongly shed:[NL]
grant me wisdom that I might know[AN]
mine own blood will not be shed[NL]
wrongly for thy sake.[AN]
