Heh heh heh.[.5] Welcome,[.4] child of fate.[AN]
Lord Duma needs you.[.5] Surely there is[NL]
no call for needless struggle.[AN]
This way,[.4] Your Highness...[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft]
You...[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadMae]
Guess what,[.4] pal?[.5] I don't care what kind[NL]
of whacko nonsense you're spouting--[AN]
I won't let you lay a finger on Celica![AN]
[MidRight]
Hmph.[.4] The buzzing of ignorant flies[NL]
is so very vexing.[AN]
Perhaps the jaws of my necrodragons[NL]
will silence your interruptions![AN]

Keh[.4] heh[.4] heh...[NL]
Come forth,[.4] dragons of the swamps![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadDolth]
Such stubborn children...[AN]
It appears a lesson in[NL]
pain is in order.[A]

Do you all really mean to fight Jedah?[AN]
I urge you to reconsider.[NL]
He's a terrifying man.[AN]
If you must fight him,[NL]
there's only one way.[AN]
Four...[.4] Eight...[.4] Twelve...[.4] Nraagh![NL]
I-[.4]it hurts...![.5] J-[.4]Jedah's...curse...![AN]

The gate Dolth was guarding marks[NL]
the entrance to the Lost Treescape.[AN]
The Sage's Hamlet,[.4] where Halcyon[NL]
lives, lies within.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Ah,[.4] there's a name I haven't[NL]
heard in some time.[AN]
It'll be good to see him again.[AN]
[FarRight]
Oh?[.4] I didn't realize[NL]
you two were acquainted.[AN]
[Right]
I'd even call him a friend.[.4] He's a good[NL]
man with a nuanced view on theology.[AN]
Back when he was the High Priest of[NL]
the Duma Faithful,[.4] he and I had many[AN]
spirited discussions about the will[NL]
of the gods and the interpretation[AN]
of their decrees.[.5] He brought up points[NL]
I hadn't even thought to consider,[AN]
and we learned much from each other.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So...[.4] it is possible for the[NL]
two faiths to coexist peacefully.[AN]
I wish I'd been alive to see it then,[NL]
but it's reassuring for the future.[AN]
[Right]
Oh,[.4] indeed.[.5] Rigel and Zofia were[NL]
not always so far apart.[.5] You know,[.4][AN]
your old granddad hails from Rigel,[.4][NL]
come to think of it.[AN]
Why,[.4] it was on that trip forty[NL]
years ago that I first met him![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mycen?[.4] Truly?[.4] But why would he[NL]
serve the Knights of Zofia...?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Oh,[.4] I may have put a good word in[NL]
for him with your great-grandsire[AN]
in dealing with some unrest at court.[AN]
With old Mycen's pride,[.4] it'd have[NL]
taken praise from the king himself[AN]
to keep him in Zofia,[.4] and by the gods,[NL]
that's exactly what I got him.[CloseEyes] Heh.[AN]
We were both so young back then...[NL]
Ah,[.4] those are fond memories.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Mm.[AN][NL]
We'll see Grandpapa again.[NL]
I know it.[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
Oh,[.4] of course we will,[.4] little one.[AN]
And Halcyon's sure to guide us[NL]
in the right direction.[AN]
...Er,[.4] speaking of which,[AN]
I'm perhaps not the best to follow[NL]
when it comes to those,[.4] heh...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha...[.4] I'm[.5] glad you're[NL]
honest about that,[.4] at least.[AN]
Sir Knight,[.4] will you be[NL]
our guide once again?[AN]
[FarRight]
Er[Beat] Right,[.4] I shan't fail you.[AN]
