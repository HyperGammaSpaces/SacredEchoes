So this is Mount Dragonsblight...[NL]
Well,[.4] that explains the name,[.4] I guess.[AN]
The heat here is hard to ignore.[AN]
It almost feels like the ground[NL]
could spit fire at any moment...[AN]
[X]

## Ch4A_6_EndingText_Bad
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
Damn,[.4] it's completely impassable...[AN]
I'm sure I could get myself[NL]
and some foot soldiers over,[AN]
but our horses and supply wagons[NL]
wouldn't make it.[AN]
We might be here a while if we[NL]
mean to dig a way through this...[AN]
[X]

[MidLeft][LoadAlmEyesClosed]
I hope Celica is doing all right...[NL][LoadAlm]
She was going to [Red]Duma Tower.[Red][AN][ToggleSmile]
Maybe from there,[.4] she could[NL]
be watching over us...[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.5]
[ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
Wait,[.4] no,[.4] she's probably got[NL]
her own safety to worry about.[AN]
I should just focus on digging.[AN]
[X]


## Ch4A_6_EndingText_Worst
[MidLeft][LoadAlmEyesClosed]
I wonder where Celica is right now...[AN][LoadAlm]
Knowing her,[.4] she'd have some[NL]
clever way to get past this.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Maybe there's [Red]somewhere she could[NL]
watch over us all from...[Red][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.5]
[ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
Wait,[.4] no,[.4] she's probably got[NL]
her own mission to worry about.[AN]
I should just focus on digging.[AN]

Heavens,[.4] what is that[NL]
infernal noise?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It sounds like... [.4][MoveMidLeft]Earthquake![NL]
Everyone,[.4] take cover![AN]
[X]

[MidLeft]
I don't believe it...[AN]
That last quake cleared[NL]
out some of the rocks--[AN]
the road's passable again.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Goodness![.4] What a stroke of[NL]
serendipity.[.4] [MoveMidRight]Come now,[.4] Alm.[AN]
Let's hurry across before[NL]
the next tremor hits.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Right...[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm?[.4] Is something the matter?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It feels strange,[.4] is all.[NL]
A little TOO convenient.[AN]
It's almost like I can feel[NL]
someone's intent behind it.[AN]
[MidRight]
An intentional rockslide?[NL][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Really,[.4] Alm,[.4] you worry too much.[AN]
Now chop chop![.4] One mustn't dawdle.[NL]
I'll await you on the far side.[AN][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][CloseEyes] ...I don't like this at all.[NL]
I hope you're all right,[.4] Celica...[AN]

Lord Duma![AN]
Every morning and every night,[.4] I[NL]
have come to pray at this altar.[AN]
Each day I bring a greater offering...[AN]
But I have not heard your voice[NL]
since the battle at the border.[AN]
Are my prayers reaching you?[NL]
What is it that I lack?[AN][CloseEyes]
I am a man of Rigel,[.4] noble by birth[NL]
and tested in battle.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
Every dross has been beaten from me[NL]
to forge me in your image.[AN][OpenEyes]
I have suffered countless abuses[NL]
in the pursuit of perfection.[AN]
I have renounced my heathen ways[NL]
and sworn fealty to you.[AN]
What more,[.4] then,[.4] must I offer up?[NL]
What more do I even have to give?![AN][NL][.6][MoveMidLeft]
ANSWER ME,[.4] LORD DUMAAAA!!![AN]
