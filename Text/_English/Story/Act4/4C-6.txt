[Left][LoadCelica_Promoted]
The tower is massive[Beat] Oppressive.[NL]
Like Duma's power given form.[AN]
[FarLeft]
There is an inscription here on the dais.[AN][2NL]
[0x93]Neither rank nor riches holds sway here.[NL]
These are but the trinkets of men.[AN]
I admit no mortal before the fire[NL]
of battle has forged him in my image.[AN]
Prove your might,[.4] and you may stand[NL]
before me as a favored warrior.[0x94][AN]
[Left]
How exactly would we [0x93]prove our might[0x94]?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Sage Halcyon,[.4] having passed this trial[NL]
many times,[.4] has told me something of it.[AN]
The [0x93]munus[0x94],[.4] in the language of our[NL]
scripture,[.4] is a trial by combat.[AN]
The grand door to Duma's altar is[NL]
sealed by his own immense power[AN]
until he sees fit to issue[NL]
the turned thumb of judgment.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadConrad]
[Left][LoadCelica_Promoted]
Each of those doors looks like[NL]
it leads to a small room.[AN]
[FarLeft]
These are the sanctums of combat.[AN]
As a trial begins,[.4] an opponent[NL]
will materialize upon the throne.[AN]
Normally,[.4] [Red]claiming the throne[Red][NL]
marks the end of the trial.[AN]
[Beat]In Father Duma's current state,[NL]
however...[.4] I fear it may take[AN]
more than a single iteration[NL]
to slake his thirst for combat.[AN]
He may [Red]continue to summon opponents[NL]
until all thrones are accounted for.[Red][AN]
[Left][MoveRight]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Anthiese,[.4] wait![.5] Once a sanctum's[NL]
throne is claimed,[.4] [Red]its door seals,[AN]
and will remain so until each[NL]
phase of the trial is decided.[Red][AN]
I beseech you, take great care[NL]
in planning your approach.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadCelica_Promoted]
I see.[.4] As much as I wish to prove[NL]
my own might to the god of strength,[AN]
[Red]I mustn't rush in and jeopardize[NL]
my chance to stand before him.[Red][AN]
Still,[.4] I wonder[Beat] these sanctums can't[NL]
merely be one-way traps,[.4] can they?[AN]
If the opponent enters by way of[AN]
the throne,[.4] then perhaps there may[NL]
be a way to [Red]leave through it[Red] as well.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That stands to reason.[AN]
However,[.4] I would think those may[NL]
lead to the catacombs below;[AN]
far from Duma and his chamber,[NL]
but near to the tower's exit.[AN]
[Right]
Then I may just have a plan.[AN]
I will trust in my companions[NL]
to face the sanctums' trials.[AN]

You will likely doubt me when I say this,[AN]
