A word, Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Clive![.4] Did we receive[NL]
a reply to our petition?[AN]
[MidRight]
Unfortunately, no.[AN]
The empire's silence is[NL]
likely its answer.[AN]
I believe it wise to[NL]
resign ourselves.[AN]
Emperor Rudolf has no intention[NL]
of treating for peace.[AN]
He means to continue his[NL]
march on Zofian soil.[AN]
[MidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
Damn...[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidRight]
Our men are approaching their limit.[AN]
And Rigel's climate is far colder[NL]
than what they knew in Zofia.[AN]
Further delaying here will only[NL]
sap their strength and morale.[AN]
[MidLeft]
All right, Clive.[NL]
I trust your judgment.[AN]
Let's get ready to march.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Understood.[AN][OpenEyes]
I'll pass word to the others and[NL]
prepare them to cross into the empire.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][Beat][OpenEyes][NL]
What's all of this leading to?[AN]

Hey, Alm! I heard the news--[NL]
guess the time's finally come, eh?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Yeah.[.4] We're headed into Rigel.[AN]
We'll need to be more careful[NL]
than ever past this point.[AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Hey, careful is my middle name![NL]
...No, really. I had it legally changed.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ToggleSmile]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
...Not even a chuckle? Really?[NL]
Come on, what's with the glowering?[AN][ToggleSmile]
We've got this.[.4][MoveMidRight] Hell, I'VE got this![AN] 
We're not the same scraggly runts we[NL]
were when we left Ram, you know?[AN]
I'll forge a new legend in battle![.4] Heh,[NL]
Clair'll probably throw herself at me.[AN]
If Tobin comes crying about suddenly[NL]
wanting to leave, don't get mad, okay?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh heh.[.4] That... would be a problem.[NL]
I need Tobin right where he is.[AN]
Thanks, Gray. For everything.[NL]
I'm counting on you.[AN]
[MidRight]
'Course.[.4][ToggleSmile] Still, I don't see why the[NL]
wind here's gotta be so damned cold.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Is it really that bad?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You're not freezing your[NL]
tenders off? I'm impressed.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's not that it doesn't feel cold.[NL]
It's more like...I know this feeling.[AN]
Like the air here's familiar.[AN]
[MidRight]
Never mind.[NL]
Come on, let's go.[AN]
