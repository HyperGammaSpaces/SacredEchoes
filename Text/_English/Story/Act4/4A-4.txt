[MidRight][LoadNuibaba][ToggleSmile]
Eee hee hee...[.4] Welcome,[NL]
warriors of the Deliverance.[AN]
My doors stand open to receive you.[AN]
You're just in time for[NL]
tonight's entertainment.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm][ToggleSmile]
Nuibaba! Then the rumors are true...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Rumors?[.4] Do tell![.4][NL]
It's no mere coincidence that[AN]
a name as illustrious as mine[NL]
is in so many mouths.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
They say you gather young women[NL]
from all across Rigel and[AN]
sacrifice them to Duma![AN][MoveMidLeft]
What right do you have[NL]
to make witches of them?![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm merely guiding them[NL]
to unlock their true power.[AN]
Those who have power and[NL]
choose not to use it are[AN]
no better than weaklings.[NL]
If fools wish to let their power[AN]
languish,[.4] then it's my right[NL]
to take it for myself![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
They didn't choose to be[NL]
sacrificed to your god![AN]
Their families didn't choose[NL]
to suffer the loss of them![AN]
I won't let you sacrifice[NL]
one soul more![AN]
[MidRight]
I'm afraid you've arrived a bit late[NL]
for that.[.4] Why don't I show you[AN]
just what sort of force[NL]
you intend to stand against?[AN]
[X]

[MidLeft][LoadTatiana]
Wha--?[.4] How did I get here?[NL]
Ooh,[.4] it's cold--[.4][MoveMidLeft]AACK! N-[.4]Nuibaba!![AN]
[MidRight]
Silence,[.4] little lamb.[.4] You're far[NL]
lovelier with your mouth shut.[AN]
[X]

## Ch4A_4_Nuibaba_SilencesTatiana
[MidLeft][LoadNuibaba][ToggleSmile]
Lord Duma![NL]
Roar your dissent,[AN]
to silence this[NL]
wailing disgrace![AN]

## Ch4_4A_OpeningText_3
[MidRight][LoadNuibaba]
[ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Eeeee hee hee hee![.4] Much better.[AN]
Now come forth,[.4] Medusa![NL]
Honor the pact you've sworn to me![AN]
Drain the life and youth from[NL]
this girl directly into my veins![AN]
[X]

[Left]
Oh,[.4] no,[.4] this is NOT good.[AN]
We've got to slay this fiend before[NL]
that poor woman is turned into a witch![AN]
[FarLeft]
But Alm,[.4] there's no way to[NL]
the roof from the ground level.[AN]
I doubt even our flying troops[NL]
could safely scale it.[AN]
[Left][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveLeft]
Rrrgh...[.4] There must be[NL]
some way to clear a path![AN]
Search every last corner[NL]
of this building![AN]
Anything that looks out[NL]
of place,[.4] investigate it![AN]
[X]

## Ch4_4A_SwitchFound
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
What's this?[.4] There's a[NL]
loose brick in this pillar.[AN][2NL]
Should I push it...?[NL][ToggleMouthMove]
[Yes]
[X]

## Ch4_4A_SwitchPushed
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Sounds like something heavy[NL]
moved to the west of here...[AN]

## Ch4A_4_Nuibaba_BattleQuote

Come close...[AN]
Let me share with you[NL]
death's embrace![A]

[MidLeft][LoadNuibaba][HalfCloseEyes]
Ahhh...[.4] It cannot be...[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadNuibaba_Gaiden]
I won't be...[A]

## Ch4_4A_TatianaFreed
[MidLeft][LoadTatiana]
The spell...[.4][ToggleSmile] it's stopped![NL]
Thank you so much![AN]
Phew...[.4] I'm already feeling better.[AN]
Once I'm back to tip-top shape,[NL]
I'll patch up all your wounds![AN]
[X]

## Ch4_4A_EndingText
[MidRight][LoadTatiana]
[Left][LoadAlm]
Are you all right?[.4] Nuibaba's spell[NL]
looked horrific.[.4] You should rest up.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thank you![.4] I'm feeling fine now,[AN]
but that was a much bigger mess[NL]
than I normally find myself in.[AN]
If you don't mind my asking,[NL]
who are you,[.4] exactly?[AN]
[Left]
We're the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Then it's true...[NL]
Zofia really HAS invaded![AN][MoveMidRight]
S-[.4]stay back![.4] Zeeeeeke![MoveMidRight] Heeeelp![AN]
[Left]
Um,[.4] we just got finished saving you.[NL]
You realize that,[.4] right?[AN]
And we didn't come all this way just[NL]
to start harming innocent Rigelians.[AN]
So long as we don't meet on the field[NL]
of battle,[.4] you're no enemy of mine.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm[Beat] not?[.4] Sorry,[.4] my heart was racing[NL]
a little faster than my brain there.[AN]
But I can see you're a man of[NL]
his word.[.4][MoveMidRight] Please forgive me![AN]
[Left]
Er,[.4] it's all right.[.5] I know[NL]
you've been through a lot.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
And technically,[.4] we DID invade,[.4] so...[OpenEyes][AN]
[MidRight]
Well,[.4] you still seem more honorable than[NL]
the troops lording over the village.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadClive]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
...Oh no![AN]
[FarLeft]
Pardon?[AN]
[MidRight]
Are you the leader of this [0x93]Deliverance[0x94]?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Of course you are.[NL]
You must be.[.5] Just look at you![AN]
In that case,[.4] I need your help.[NL]
My lover,[.4] Zeke,[.4] is in peril![AN]
[FarLeft]
Forgive me,[.4] milady,[.4] but I fear that[NL]
isn't the case.[.4] I am not the leader[AN]
of the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
But you're so tall and dashing![NL]
I thought for sure...[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hmm...[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadLukas]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
It's YOU,[.4] isn't it?[.5] Yes,[.4] it must be![NL]
Witness the focused air about you![AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh.[.4] Wrong again,[.4] I fear.[NL]
Alm here commands us.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
What?[AN]
[Left]
Uh...[.4] hey there.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ack![.4] F-[.4]forgive me![.4] It's just that[NL]
you're so young and[Beat] young.[AN]
[Left]
Don't worry about it.[.5] Tell us more[NL]
about this [0x93]Zeke[0x94] person.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah yes![.4] Zeke![.4] Ezekiel![.4] You're on[NL]
your way to Rigel Castle,[.4] right?[AN]
Then you're certain to meet Zeke on[NL]
the Rigel Plains along the way.[AN][ToggleSmile]
When that happens,[.4] don't kill him![NL][MoveMidRight]
Don't you DARE![AN]
His superior officer,[.4] Jerome,[.4][NL]
is a no-good,[.4] rotten lout.[AN]
He and Nuibaba have brought immense[NL]
suffering upon the locals.[AN]
Zeke tried to stand up to[NL]
Jerome and his wicked ways,[AN]
but once I was taken captive,[NL]
my love had no choice but to obey.[AN][ToggleSmile]
If you tell Zeke I'm free,[.4] however,[.4][NL]
I know he'll fight for what's right.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
All right,[.4] but this Zeke--[.4]er,[.4] Ezekiel--[NL]
is a Rigelian soldier,[.4] isn't he?[AN]
If he attacks us,[.4] we'll have no choice[NL]
but to answer in kind.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Aw,[.4] he won't attack you.[NL]
He's a sweetie pie![AN]
Heck,[.4] he's going to be over the moon[NL]
about how you all saved me![AN]
In fact,[.4] I'm sure he'll[NL]
even come to your aid.[AN]
He's just that kind of man.[NL][CloseEyes]
Oh,[.4] Zeke![AN]
[Left]
You're oddly[Beat] convincing.[NL]
I actually believe you.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Of course you do![.4] Just remember,[.4][NL]
no killing my sweet Zeke.[.4] Got it?[AN]
I know you'll get him out of[NL]
his predicament.[.4] I just know it.[AN][.6]
Hey,[.4] wait a second...[NL]
Why don't I go WITH you?[AN][MoveMidRight]
I just miss my love so much![AN]
[Left]
Well,[.4] you certainly seem like[NL]
you're feeling up to it.[AN]
We'd be glad to have you.[AN]
If he sees you in person with us,[NL]
that'll be the safest option,[.4] right?[AN]

She's not...[.4] coming back.[NL]
Clive,[.4] she's not coming back...![AN]
But[Beat] we killed Nuibaba.[.4] It should...[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm...[.4] War is a cruel thief.[NL]
...But we did all we could.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I knew there would be sacrifices,[.4] but...[NL][MoveMidLeft]
Our best effort still wasn't good enough.[AN]
[MidRight]
Think on it logically for a moment.[AN]
With Nuibaba gone,[.4] no more innocents[NL]
will be subjected to her evil deeds.[AN]
Civilian casualties are never easy,[.4] but[NL]
you mustn't lose hope because of this.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
Clive,[.4] I[Beat] I won't be shoved off[NL]
the path I'm taking because of[AN]
one civilian death.[.4] Don't worry.[NL]
But I can't stop at just Nuibaba.[AN]
Whatever it is about this land that[NL]
drives the sacrifice of innocent souls,[AN]
I won't rest until it's reckoned[NL]
with my blade.[.4][MoveMidLeft] I swear it![AN]
