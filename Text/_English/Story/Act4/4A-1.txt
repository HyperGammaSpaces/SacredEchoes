Alm? We're ready to march.[AN]
According to our intelligence,[NL]
Rigel's forces await in the[AN]
forest ahead. General Berkut[NL]
is commanding them personally.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Berkut...[.4] I guess they're serious[NL]
about holding the border.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed.[.4] Yet we've no[NL]
choice but to cross it.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...Right.[AN]

You kept me waiting, Alm.[AN]
I was starting to wonder[NL]
if you'd actually come.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Berkut![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's quite the little army you've[NL]
assembled. I'm almost impressed.[AN]
For a ragtag group of gathered scraps,[NL]
the Deliverance actually looks the part.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Still, it seems you've all let a few[NL]
meager successes go to your heads.[AN]
Who are you to dare threaten[NL]
Rigel's borders? Lowborn fool.[AN]
Do you truly fancy yourself[NL]
the next king of Zofia?![AN][MoveMidLeft]
You must learn your place![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadClive][FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
You've got it all wrong, Berkut.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveFarLeft][MidLeft][LoadFernand][MidLeft][MoveLeft][Left]
Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've been at Alm's side from the[NL]
outset, watching all that he has done.[AN]
He's a brave warrior, and a good man[AN]
worthy of the crown.[.4] He's made such[NL]
clear to me time and again.[AN]
The right of kings is not decided[NL]
by blood or station.[AN]
It lies in what a man believes.[NL]
What keeps him up at night.[AN][MoveMidRight]
It lies in a man's actions![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
E-[.4]Enough already![AN]
You would throw away your pride as a[NL]
Zofian noble and bow to a commoner?![AN][CloseEyes]
I see now that the Clive I once knew[NL]
is well and truly dead.[AN][OpenEyes][MoveLeft]
Now it falls on me to bury him![AN]

Sorry. I'm ready.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

Warriors, it's time![AN]
Time to defeat Emperor Rudolf, and[NL]
bring this bloody war to an end![AN]
Now then--[.4]who will defend Zofia?![AN]

We will defend her![AN]

[MidRight][LoadYoungwoman]
Lord Berkut is the son of the Emperor's[NL]
late younger brother. As a boy,[AN]
he was so timid that the sheer size[NL]
of a horse could make him cry in fear.[AN]
What a farce that would have been if[NL]
his mother hadn't broken him of it![AN]
But now, he's grown into a strong[NL]
(and handsome!) young man worthy[AN]
of the Rigelian throne...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Ooh, if that miserable little lord[NL]
hadn't betrothed his daughter to him[AN]
just for the hefty dower,[NL]
I'd still have room to dream...[AN]

What light clothing![NL]
Aren't you underdressed?[AN]
[Beat]Oh. Zofians.[AN]
Well, it's not my place[NL]
to turn away a traveler.[AN]
But I'll not tolerate your ways[NL]
in my house, do you hear?[AN]
You should know that we Rigelians have[NL]
no fondness for lushes and layabouts.[AN]

Great work out there, soldiers.[NL]
You did your duty well.[AN]
[MidRight]
Only because you led us well, sir![AN]
The Rigelian troops left this lance[NL]
behind in one of the forts.[AN]
We think it'd be best used by[NL]
the front-line units.[AN]

Nnngh... Damn you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're plenty strong, Berkut.[NL]
No one would deny that.[AN]
If you lay down your weapon, I'll[NL]
let you escape with your life.[AN]
But if you don't... I won't[NL]
give you a third chance.[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes][MoveRight]
Bah! Spare me your treacly platitudes![NL]
I was meant for greatness![AN]
But you, you're just a...[NL]
just a...[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight]

--What the devil do YOU want?![AN]
[FarRight][CloseEyes]
I[Beat][OpenEyes] I have a report.[NL]
We've taken severe casualties.[AN]
We'd be wise to use[NL]
this chance to escape.[AN]
[Left]
Who do you think you are to[NL]
give orders to me?![AN]
Perhaps you wish to scurry away[NL]
like the Zofian you are,[AN]
but I intend to stay and fight.[AN]
Had YOU not faltered in the[NL]
face of your former comrade,[AN]
I would've gotten my[NL]
rightful victory by now![AN]
[FarRight]
Lord Berkut, they offer you mercy.[NL]
Pray at least consider their terms.[AN]
His Excellency the Emperor[NL]
will understand.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Shut your mouth, Zofian scum![AN]
I would rather die here than crawl[NL]
back to my uncle to beg for mercy.[AN]
Mercy belongs in the limp wrists[NL]
of Zofia, not in the clenched fists[AN]
of Rigelian men where lances instead[NL]
ought to be!![AN]

Lord Berkut![.4] My apologies[NL]

We've come to relieve you.[AN]

Ezekiel?! What are you--[.4][MoveLeft]You were[NL]
to stay posted at the forest village![AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
A missive from the Emperor took[NL]
precedence--[.4]His Excellency wishes[AN]
to see your safe return.[AN]
For this reason, General Jerome[NL]
granted me leave to assist you.[AN]
Command us as you see fit.[AN]
[Left][HalfCloseEyes]
Is that so?[NL][OpenEyes]
Then, I command you to return.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Lord Berkut?[.4] But, your injury--[AN]

I'll not take your pity![NL]
Return to your post.[AN]
That is my only command[NL]

Milord, if I may be so bold--[AN]
can we truly afford to turn aside[NL]
reinforcements in a state like this?[AN]
With those troops, perhaps we--[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
My decision is final![AN]
Of all the soldiers in Rigel,[NL]
my uncle chose to send HIM.[AN]
I will not tolerate such an[NL]
affront to my pride.[AN]
If fighting alongside him is[NL]
the price of a warrior's death,[AN]
then that is a price I'll[NL]
not stoop to pay.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]I understand, milord.[AN]
His Excellency expects our[NL]
presence.[.4] Let us make haste.[AN]

try to calm down.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

You are safe. That's[NL]

you possibly know?![AN]

Berkut...[AN]
[MidLeft]
From childhood, all that's ever[NL]
been asked of me is strength.[AN]
It is my duty as one born to[NL]
stand above others.[.4] To rule.[AN]
I've been taught that all my life.[NL]
By my father, my mother...[AN][MoveMidLeft]
How am I to remain calm in the face[NL]
of defeat at the hands of peasants?![AN]

Berkut? You're frightening me...[NL]
I-[.4]I can brew you some tea if you'd--[AN]

I did not mean to eavesdrop.[AN][OpenEyes]
His demeanor has been troubling[NL]
since the battle at the border,[AN]
and I felt it prudent to[NL]
keep close watch on him.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] I see him so little when[NL]
he is away for the campaign.[AN]
Then he returns, and I see him[NL]
less still.[AN]
But he has never raised his voice[AN]
to me like this[Beat] I'd hoped to[NL]
spend some time together for a change.[AN][.6]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]War changes people.[.4] Sometimes,[NL]
it changes them beyond recognition.[AN]
There is a point when one must consider[NL]
that the person they once loved is gone.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
No... I shall stay with him.[AN]
Deep down, he is hurting, and[NL]
I will be there to comfort him.[AN]
I have faith that with a bit[NL]
more time, things will return[AN]
to what they were.[AN]
