Alm?[.4] We're ready to march.[AN]
According to our intelligence,[NL]
Rigel's forces await in the[AN]
forest ahead.[.4] General Berkut[NL]
is commanding them personally.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Berkut...[.4] I guess they're serious[NL]
about holding the border.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed.[.4] Yet we've no[NL]
choice but to cross it.[AN]

You kept me waiting,[.4] Alm.[AN]
I was starting to wonder[NL]
if you'd actually come.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Berkut![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's quite the little army you've[NL]
assembled.[.4] I'm almost impressed.[AN]
For a ragtag group of gathered scraps,[NL]
the Deliverance actually looks the part.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Still,[.4] it seems you've all let a few[NL]
meager successes go to your heads.[AN]
Who are you to dare threaten[NL]
Rigel's borders?[.4] Lowborn fool.[AN]
Do you truly fancy yourself[NL]
the next king of Zofia?![AN][MoveMidLeft]
You must learn your place![AN]

Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've been at Alm's side from the[NL]
outset,[.4] watching all that he has done.[AN]
He's a brave warrior,[.4] and a good man[AN]
worthy of the crown.[.5] He's made such[NL]
clear to me time and again.[AN]
The right of kings is not decided[NL]
by blood or station.[AN]
It lies in what a man believes.[NL]
What keeps him up at night.[AN][MoveMidRight]
It lies in a man's actions![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
E-[.4]Enough already![AN]
You would throw away your pride as a[NL]
Zofian noble and bow to a commoner?![AN][CloseEyes]
I see now that the Clive I once knew[NL]
is well and truly dead.[AN][OpenEyes][MoveLeft]
Now it falls on me to bury him![AN]

Lord Berkut is the son of the Emperor's[NL]
late younger brother.[.4] As a boy,[AN]
he was so timid that the sheer size[NL]
of a horse could make him cry in fear.[AN]
What a farce that would have been if[NL]
his mother hadn't broken him of it![AN]
But now,[.4] he's grown into a strong[NL]
(and handsome!)[.4] young man worthy[AN]
of the Rigelian throne...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Ooh,[.4] if that miserable little lord[NL]
hadn't betrothed his daughter to him[AN]
just for the hefty dower,[NL]
I'd still have room to dream...[AN]

Aren't you underdressed?[AN]
[Beat]Oh.[.4] Zofians.[AN]
Well,[.4] it's not my place[NL]
to turn away a traveler.[AN]
But I'll not tolerate your ways[NL]

You should know that we Rigelians have[NL]
no fondness for lushes and layabouts.[AN]

You did your duty well.[AN]

Only because you led us well,[.4] sir![AN]
The Rigelian troops left this lance[NL]

the front-line units.[AN]

You're plenty strong,[.4] Berkut.[NL]
No one would deny that.[AN]
If you lay down your weapon,[.4] I'll[NL]
let you leave with your life.[AN]
But if you don't...[.4] I won't[NL]
give you a third chance.[AN]

Bah![.4] Spare me your treacly platitudes![NL]
I was meant for greatness![AN]

this chance to escape.[AN]

Who do you think you are to[NL]
give orders to me?![AN]
Perhaps you wish to slink away[NL]
like the Zofian you are,[AN]
but I intend to stay and fight.[AN]
Had YOU not faltered in the[NL]
face of your former comrade,[AN]
I would've seized my[NL]
rightful victory by now![AN]
[FarRight]
Lord Berkut,[.4] they offer you mercy.[AN]
His Excellency the Emperor[NL]
will understand.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Shut your mouth,[.4] Zofian scum![AN]
I would rather die here than crawl[NL]
back to my uncle to beg for mercy.[AN]
Mercy belongs in the limp wrists[NL]
of Zofia,[.4] not in the clenched fists[AN]
of Rigelian men where lances instead[NL]
ought to be!![AN]

For this reason,[.4] General Jerome[NL]

My decision is final![AN]
Of all the soldiers in Rigel,[NL]
my uncle chose to send HIM.[AN]
I will not tolerate such an[NL]
affront to my pride.[AN]
If fighting alongside him is[NL]
the price of a warrior's death,[AN]
then that is a price I'll[NL]

I[Beat] I see him so little when[NL]
he is away for the campaign.[AN]
Then he returns,[.4] and I[NL]

spend some time together for a change.[AN][.6]

it changes them beyond recognition.[AN]
