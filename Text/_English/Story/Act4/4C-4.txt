Wheeeew![.4] It sure is nice to be[NL]
out of that creepy forest.[AN]
If we'd been stuck there any longer,[NL]
I would've had to start blaming yew![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mm[Beat] Well,[.4] I'm glad you're[NL]
keeping your spirits up, Mae.[AN]
We could all use morale like[NL]
yours at a time like this.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh,[.4] Celica,[.4] if you hadn't noticed,[NL]
I was making a joke.[AN]
You're supposed to laugh?[AN][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
C'mon,[.4] you don't have to be[NL]
such a birch about it![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Right...[.4] I'm sorry.[.4] There's a[NL]
lot on my mind right now.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I knew that,[.4] silly![.4] That's why[NL]
I was trying to make you laugh![AN]
You know,[.4] to get your[NL]
mind OFF all that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...You're a good friend,[.4] Mae.[NL]
I appreciate it,[.4] truly.[AN]
But this[Beat] This isn't the time[NL]
for laughter and games.[AN]
There's too much riding on my shoulders[NL]
to risk loosening them now.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][MoveLeft]
Celica?![.5] Celica,[.4] wait![AN][MoveLeft]
Princess or not,[.4] you're[NL]
still my best friend![AN]
What happened to my best friend,[.4] huh?![AN]

You seem troubled,[.4] little one.[AN][2NL]
Were Sage Halcyon's words[NL]
any comfort to you?[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
They were.[.4] I know now what I must do.[AN]
...Though,[.4] truthfully,[.4] it doesn't make[NL]
my task any easier to stomach.[AN]
[MidRight]
Speak of it to me,[.4] child.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I cannot.[AN][2NL]
The look on Alm's face[NL]
when I told him...[AN]
I won't be able to bear it if[NL]
I see that look on yours as well.[AN]
All we can do is trust in[NL]
Mila's will,[.4] and move forward.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You told the boy goodbye,[NL]
didn't you?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]*gasp*![.4][ToggleMouthMove] How did you--[AN]
[MidRight]
Call it intuition--[.4]I,[.4] too,[.4][NL]
have said my share of goodbyes[AN]
to those I've held dear.[AN]
In such times,[.4] we must remember:[NL]
The wefts of our lives and bonds[AN]
are both woven and clipped in turn[NL]
as the Mother wills it.[AN]
We cannot know the full design of[NL]
her tapestry;[.4] we can only trust[AN]
that our own threads fit into it,[AN]
guided through by the needle of our own[NL]
resolve in the grasp of her expert hand.[AN]
So I must ask--[.4]what is the needle[NL]
to which you've threaded your fate?[AN]
[MidLeft]
...The Brand exists to guide me.[AN]
And the Brand marks my blood as that[NL]
which can heal the gods' illness.[AN]
[MidRight]
And your heart says this is right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It does.[.4] Restoring the gods[NL]
will heal this suffering land.[AN]
[MidRight]
To say that without hesitation[NL]
tells a story in itself.[AN]
[Beat]Then I,[.4] too,[.4] will trust in the Mother.[NL]
You needn't add my worries to your own.[AN][ToggleSmile]
As sure as your faith is,[.4] mine,[NL]
too,[.4] will guide me through.[AN]
So fear not,[.4] little one,[.4] and know[NL]
that wherever your thread may end,[AN]
you'll be led there by the strength of[NL]
your faith and the will of the Mother,[AN]
and the stitch you'll make together[NL]
will anchor countless others.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you...[.4][CloseEyes] Nomah...[AN]

Mr. Mask.[.4] We need to talk.[AN]

[Beat]Pray tell,[.4] what on?[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
You've been having an awful lot of[NL]
[0x93]private conversations[0x94] with Celica.[AN]
Did you think I wouldn't catch on?[AN]
[MidRight]
Er[Beat] I'm sorry?[.4] I-[.4]I'm[NL]
afraid I don't know--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][Right]
Don't play dumb with me,[.4] kid.[AN]
I know what boys your age want a[NL]
private audience with a princess for.[AN]
If you dare lay ONE finger on her,[NL]
I'll snap it right off your hand.[AN]
Got it?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][FarRight]
E-[.4]Excuse me?![.4] No, no,[.4] you've[NL]
got it all wrong,[.4] that isn't at all--[AN]
[Right]
You better have a damn[NL]
good alibi,[.4] then.[AN]
[FarRight]
I--[.4] Um,[.4] well,[.4] you're--[AN][MoveFarRight]
I can't help but,[.4] uh,[.4] notice how[Beat][NL][ToggleSmile]
strong[Beat] your muscles are when...[AN]
when you pick me up by[NL]
the collar like that.[.4] Heh...[AN]
H-[.4]Has anyone told you you're[NL]
a fine specimen of a man?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
A lot of people,[.4] actually.[AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]
Right,[.4] of course![.4] Your eyes are like--[.4][NL]
well,[.4] um,[.4] your eye,[.4] I mean--[AN]
it sparkles like when the autumn sun[NL]
hits a glass of fine brandy--[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile][MoveLeft][Left]
[Beat]Tch.[AN]
If that's what you call [0x93]flirting[0x94],[.4] I[NL]
guess I don't have much to worry about.[AN]
Just remember--[.4]I've got my eye on you.[NL]
No funny business.[AN][ClearFace]

either of those thoughts...[AN]
