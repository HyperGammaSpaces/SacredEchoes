Why's Clair flying[NL]
so high up there?[AN]
[Left]
Lady Clair is scouting[NL]
that fort from above.[AN]
She'll be able to see whether there[NL]
are reinforcements waiting inside.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Whoa...[.4] That's a great skill to have.[AN]
I never thought of all the ways having[NL]
a pegasus could help in combat.[AN]
Back in Ram Village,[NL]
they were just myths to us.[AN]
[Left]
Outside of a miracle from the goddess,[NL]
most people would never see one.[AN]
They're incredibly rare[NL]
and fickle creatures[AN]
who nest in the Macedon[NL]
mountains in Archanea.[AN]
Importing one to Valentia[NL]
is nigh impossible.[AN]
Lady Clair is the only person I've[NL]
ever met who paid for one.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You mean...[.4] she BOUGHT that?[NL]
J-[.4]Just how much are we talking--[AN]

I've taken the liberty to[NL]
observe from above,[AN]
and the fort ahead appears to be[NL]
only lightly manned.[AN]
I propose we go ahead and take it.[AN]
[Left]
Lady Clair,[.4] are you sure that's a[NL]
wise use of our resources?[AN]
If it's lightly manned,[.4] it would[NL]
be less threat to simply avoid it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Surely you jest, Lukas![AN]
What a blow to their morale it would[NL]
be to capture their fort unannounced![AN]
Not to mention laying claim to[NL]
their rations and supplies.[AN]
[FarLeft]
If they don't have it manned,[NL]
then they don't want to keep it.[AN]
At least,[.4] I think that's how[NL]
it works[Beat] right?[AN]
[MidRight]
Splendid![.4] Alm agrees with me.[NL]
Everyone--[.4]show them what-for![AN]

[CloseEyes][.4]I do hope we won't regret this...[AN]

You're between me and[NL]

Clair![.4] You're safe![AN]
[Right]
Oh![.4] Good day,[.4] Fernand.[NL]
And what brings you here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Need you even ask?[NL]
When I heard you had been taken[AN]
prisoner,[.4] I mounted my finest[NL]
destrier and sped here at once.[AN]
Sir Clive couldn't leave the[NL]
hideout without its commander--[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
regardless,[.4] I see I am a step[NL]
behind.[.5] Who is this rabble?[AN]
[FarRight]
Um,[.4] are you talking about us?[AN]
[Right]
They are not [0x93]rabble[0x94], Fernand.[AN]
This boy is Alm.[.5] He is the[NL]
grandson of Sir Mycen himself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mycen's[Beat] grandson?[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Lukas--[.4]I demand to know[NL]
the meaning of this![AN]
You were ordered to[NL]
find the general himself![AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadLukas]
[FarRight]
Sadly,[.4] Sir Mycen was not[NL]
so easily convinced.[AN]
However,[.4] Alm and his friends have[NL]
joined our cause in his stead.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft]
Is this some manner of folly to you,[NL]
Lukas?[.4] Am I to be amused?[AN]
Such baseborn curs cannot[NL]
possibly aid our cause.[AN]
The Deliverance has no place for[NL]
riffraff with pitchforks and torches.[AN]
[FarRight]
Fernand, listen to reason.[AN]
These [0x93]curs[0x94] you so easily[NL]
disparage fought valiantly for us.[AN]
In fact,[.4] without Alm,[.4] we might not[NL]
have retaken the Southern Outpost.[AN]
I can vouch for them.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hah![.4] As if the word of a mere backwater[NL]
noble carries weight with me.[AN]
Your whole house should be kissing[NL]
the Knights of Zofia's feet![AN]
[FarRight]
Grrh[Beat][AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadAlm]
[FarRight]
That's enough.[.5] You can say whatever[NL]
nasty things about me you'd like--[AN]
I'll get over it.[.5] But Lukas[NL]
deserves your respect.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I beg your pardon?[AN]
Do I look like a man who listens[NL]
to the opinions of peasants?[AN]
[Right]
Then you can listen to me,[.4] because[NL]
I happen to agree with him.[AN]
My brother already explained[NL]
this to you,[.4] did he not?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sir Clive?[NL]
What exactly did he explain?[AN]
[Right]
[0x93]A soldier's worth is not determined[NL]
by the station of his birth.[AN]
If we do not all fight together as one,[NL]
then we will never defeat Desaix.[0x94][AN]
Those are wise words.[NL]
Unforgettable words![AN]
Desaix's forces already have us at heel,[NL]
yet you would splinter us further?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Rrr[Beat] You there![.4] Boy![AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]That's me,[.4] I take it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Out of respect for Sir Clive,[.4] I will[NL]
permit you to join the Deliverance.[AN]
But you WILL learn your place![AN]
Now,[.4] Clair.[AN]
Seeing as you are safe, you have[NL]
no need for these people.[AN]
Come,[.4] let us return.[.5] We must report[NL]
this matter to Sir Clive at once.[AN]
[Right]
I will do no such thing![NL]
I'm going with Alm.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Sir Clive will be galled with[NL]
me if I do not return with you.[AN][OpenEyes]
On that condition alone,[.4] I will allow[NL]
that boy to accompany us.[AN]

[Beat]Wow,[.4] what a jerk![NL]
I've never met someone so rude![AN]
[Left]
I guess we've been spoiled by Lukas.[AN]
He'd nearly convinced me that[NL]
swinish knights are the exception,[AN]
not the rule.[.5] But[Beat][NL]
that was a pig, all right.[.4] *snort*[AN]
[MidRight]
You poor dears must be so upset.[AN]
I apologize for the way[NL]
he treated you.[AN]
[Left]
Don't be silly.[NL]
You don't have to lower yourself[AN]
for a miserable human being[NL]
like that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh my...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Oh, great.[.5] Here we go...[AN]

What?[.4] I have no idea what[NL]
you're talkin' about.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well,[.4] regardless...[.5] please don't[NL]
think ill of Fernand.[AN]
He wasn't always like this.[AN]
The world[Beat] changed him.[AN]

Did...[.4] something happen to him?[AN]

We live in trying times.[.5] And some[NL]

difficult to put into words.[.5] In[NL]
any case, we should be on our way.[AN]
