[MidRight]
You did well in your training today, Alm.[NL]
We'll rest here.[.5] How about some lunch?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You really think so?[.4] You're not just[NL]
saying that, are you, Grandfather?[AN]
[MidRight]
Either I'm getting old or you're getting[NL]
better--[.5]and we both know I'm not old.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha![.5] Then, that means you'll finally[NL]
let me travel outside the village.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't misconstrue my words, boy.[NL]
The rule still stands.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But why?![.5] I'm not a child anymore.[NL]
You just said I can fend for myself![AN]
[MidRight]
Alm, that's not what this is about.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Then what IS it about?[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Look, I've heard from the others.[NL]
Zofia's getting to be a scary place.[AN]
Because of the drought,[.4] many have become[NL]
desperate enough to rob and plunder.[AN]
And don't think I haven't also heard[NL]
about what the Rigelian army has been[AN]
up to in the borderlands...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]All true.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So,[.4] Zofia's people need help,[.4] then.[NL]
And I want to go and help them.[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Please, Grandfather![.4] Let me use these[NL]
skills you've taught me for something.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've taught you self-defense,[NL]
Alm,[.4] not self-endangerment.[AN]
Just as I've taught to the[NL]
other youths in the village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
...Hmph. None of them even bothered[NL]
to show up for their lessons today.[AN][OpenEyes]
Go see what they have to say for[NL]
themselves while I'm cooking.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Gray![.4] Tobin![.4] Where were you guys--[NL]
Huh? Who's that with the armor?[AN]
[FarRight]
Alm![.4] Hey.[AN]
This fellow's here to see Sir Mycen.[NL]
He was just about to tell us more.[AN]
[Clear]
[Right][Clear]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
[MidRight]
Good day.[.5] You must be Sir Mycen's grandson.[NL]
Alm, was it?[.5] My name is Lukas.[AN]
I fight for the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The [0x93]Deliverance[0x94]?[.5] What's that?[NL]
Aren't you one of the Knights of Zofia?[AN]
The king's knights?[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, I see.[.5] I suppose that means word hasn't[NL]
yet reached your village.[AN]
In that case, please forgive me for[NL]
heralding such dark news, but[Beat][AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
King Lima IV is dead.[AN]
He met his end some days ago at[NL]
the hands of Chancellor Desaix.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[NL]
You're saying it was regicide?![AN]
[MidRight]
I fear so.[AN]
It seems Desaix sold Zofia,[NL]
and his soul,[.4] to the Rigelian Empire.[AN]
With their aid,[.4] he has seized the[NL]
castle and begun visiting injustices[AN]
upon those loyal to the King.[AN]
Sir Clive,[.4] of the Knights of Zofia,[NL]
would not stand for Desaix's abuses,[AN]
and founded a resistance army.[NL]
That would be the Deliverance.[AN]
However,[.4] our situation is dire.[NL]
We need a hero's aid.[AN]
And so I have come to the home of one[NL]
of Zofia's greatest heroes: Sir Mycen.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.5]
[MidRight]
Do you see, Alm?[AN]
Sir Clive would not have sent me[NL]
were it not urgent.[AN]
Will you take me to see[NL]
your grandfather?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-yes, of course.[A]

Good goblets...[.5] I knew Zofia was in[NL]
hot water, but is this guy serious?[AN]
[FarRight]
So there's going to be a war?[A]
[FarLeft]
There already is one,[NL]
from the sound of things.[AN]
[Left]
But that's[Beat] that's awful![AN]
If Sir Mycen rides off to war,[NL]
what'll happen to Alm?[AN]
[FarLeft]
You got me.[A]

##OpeningScene_4
[Right][LoadAlm]
[FarRight][LoadLukas]
[MidLeft][LoadMycen]
[FarRight]
Good day, Sir Mycen.[NL]
My name is Lukas.[AN]
I have come on behalf of--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you've come to the wrong place.[NL]
This is a simple farming village,[AN]
and I came here specifically[NL]
to be left alone.[AN]
[FarRight]
...Sir Mycen, please.[NL]
Zofia is in dire need.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sorry, young squire,[NL]
but I've long since retired.[AN]
I know what you're after,[NL]
and I want no part in it.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]So be it.[AN]
Thank you for your time.[NL]
I'll be on my way.[AN]
[Right]
Grandfather![.4] Wait--[NL]
If you won't, then I will![AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft]
What?![.4] Join the Deliverance?[NL]
Absolutely not.[.5] I won't allow it.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Right][MoveRight]
[Right]
Then why did you teach me the[NL]
sword if I never get to use it?![AN]
I'm tired of training.[NL]
I'm tired of this town.[AN]
I'm tired of being stuck here doing[NL]
NOTHING as the rest of Zofia suffers![AN]
[MidLeft]
Suppose you do set forth with your[NL]
sword and your wits.[.5] So what?[AN]
[Right][Beat][Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Will the grand story of your life be[NL]
how you met the end of a brigand's axe?[AN]
Before you dream of changing the world,[NL]
learn your damned place in it.[AN]
And no more talk of leaving.[AN][ClearFace]

##OpeningScene_5
[FarFarLeft][LoadAlm]
[Right][LoadTobin]
[Left][LoadLukas]
[FarRight][LoadGray]
[Left][CloseEyes]
It seems we misplaced our hopes.[AN][OpenEyes]
I'll have to return to the hideout[NL]
and bring Sir Clive the ill news.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarRight]
That's rough, buddy.[.4] Sir Mycen[NL]
is ridiculously strong.[AN]
I don't know why he wasn't[NL]
willing to help you out.[AN]
[Left]
Perhaps he has simply grown too[NL]
old for the battlefield...[AN]
Well, it was good meeting you all.[NL]
Thank you again for your assistance.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Lukas,[.4] wait![.4][NL]
I'm joining the Deliverance.[AN]
[Left]
...Alm?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Grandfather's not old![.4] He's[NL]
tougher than men half his age.[AN]
And if he won't fight for you,[NL]
then I'll do it for him.[AN]
Consider my sword as his.[AN]
[Right]
Alm, what the hell?![NL]
You can't do that![AN]
[Beat]Wait.[.5] CAN he do that?[AN]
[FarRight]
I'll admit, you fight like a beast and[NL]
they'd be lucky to have your sword,[AN]
but this isn't sparring with your[NL]
gramps, Alm.[AN]
You're volunteering to go to war![AN]
[FarLeft]
Sir Mycen has been teaching me to[NL]
use a blade since I was a boy.[AN]
And not just that.[.5] He also taught me[NL]
tactics, terrain, and medicine.[AN]
Let me fight for you with his gifts.[AN]
I'll prove he's no cowardly old man.[NL]
He's a warrior who trains warriors.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Hmm...[.5] That might just work.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Huh?[.5] Then you mean...![AN]
[Right]
[Clear]
[Right][LoadKliff]
[Right]
Oh, come ON![.5] You can't be serious![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Why not?[.5] Alm presents a good case.[NL]
He has a hero's blood in him.[AN]
His presence is sure to raise[NL]
the troops' morale.[AN]
And for my part, I'm curious to see[NL]
what a self-proclaimed warrior can do.[AN]
Especially now that he'll be[NL]
doing it for the Deliverance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Thank you, Lukas...[NL]
You won't regret this![AN]
[FarRight]
I've seen a lot of cake-taking in[NL]
my day, but this REALLY takes the cake![AN]
[FarRight]
[Clear]
[FarRight][LoadFaye]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Alm, you should back out of this.[NL]
It's far too dangerous![AN]
If anything were to happen to you,[NL]
I'd[Beat][AN]
I mean[Beat] Just don't do it, okay?![AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm sorry, Faye, but I've[NL]
made up my mind.[AN]
But...[.5] maybe all of you[NL]
could come with me?[AN]
[FarRight]
Er, what?[AN]
[Right]
Splendid idea.[.5] Maybe we could all[NL]
get impaled on the same lance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm just saying we could do it together.[NL]
[Beat]Fighting, I mean.[.5] Not the lance.[AN]
Grandfather trained all of us, right?[NL]
Not just me.[AN]
You already know how to use a sword.[NL]
So what's the problem?[AN]
[Right]
[Clear]
[Right][LoadTobin]
[Right]
Alm, are you insane?[.5] We were sparring[NL]
with wooden fences and tree trunks![AN]
They don't hit back![AN]
[FarRight]
[Clear]
[FarRight][LoadGray]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, sod it all.[.5] I'm not as bright as[NL]
I'd like to think I am, so, uh...[AN]
count me in![AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Gray! Not you too?![AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Me too, Tobi-poo.[.5] Better'n waiting for[NL]
Rigel to come and kill-slash-enslave us.[AN]
Might as well bring the fight to them.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
But you're gonna--[.5] I mean, once they--[NL]
[.....][MoveRight]...Ugggh![AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
You have my thanks, Gray.[NL]
And the Deliverance welcomes you.[AN]
In the end, we need every able[NL]
fighter we can get.[AN]
There will be much to learn,[AN]
but I can teach you[NL]
a great deal in battle.[AN]
And you'll be given a[NL]
proper wage, of course.[AN]
[Right]
Wait.[.5] You mean we get paid?[NL]
As in, actual money?[AN]
[Left]
Of course.[.5] Our soldiers work hard[NL]
and sacrifice much.[AN]
We would be remiss[NL]
not to offer compensation.[AN]
[Right]
I've got little brothers and sisters[NL]
who could use that gold...[AN]
Ma and Pa struggle to make ends meet,[NL]
but if there's a way to help... Hmm...[AN]
[Beat]All right.[.5] Count me in, too.[AN]
[Left]
Splendid news.[AN]
I'm sure you're all in need of[NL]
some time to say your good-byes.[AN]
I'll be waiting.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Got it.[.4] I need to go thank my[NL]
grandfather before I leave.[AN]
[X]

##OpeningScene_WheresGrandpa

Grandfather, I'm home![NL]
Do you have a minute?[AN]
There's something I need to[NL]

to say good-bye to your grandpa?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
I tried,[.4] but[Beat] I couldn't find him.[AN]
[FarLeft]
That's weird.[.4] Do you want to[NL]
wait a bit longer so you can--[AN]
[Right]
It's all right.[.4] Let's go.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]You sure?[AN]
[Right]
I'll write him a letter.[NL]
Come on,[.4] we can't wait forever.[AN]
[Left]
Alm, seriously,[.4] are you[NL]
absolutely sure about this?[AN]
You're the only family he's got.[NL]
And all you have is him.[AN]
[Right]
I know.[.4] But considering he's never let[NL]
me take one step outside the village,[AN]
I doubt anything I could say would[AN]
change his mind.[.4] And he wouldn't be able[NL]
to change mine,[.4] either.[.4] I HAVE to go.[AN]
Not just to prove him as a teacher,[NL]
but to prove myself to me.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, you've always wanted to put[NL]
Ram behind you, right?[AN]
This is your big chance![NL]
Your first adventure writ large![AN]
We'll call it Alm's Epoch![AN]
Or maybe...[.5] The Tale of Gray![NL]
[Beat]Plus That One Guy.[AN]
[Right]
Heh.[.4] I don't think so.[AN]
Although I admit there might be[NL]
something to what you're saying.[AN]
It's almost as if I feel[NL]
someone calling out to me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
...So you really have gone crazy then.[NL]
Welp, it's been nice knowin' ya![AN]
[Right]
Heh.[.5] Look, I know how it sounds.[NL]
But it's the truth.[AN]

[MidLeft]
One more thing, Alm.[.5] You've all brought[NL]
swords, but I'm trained in the lance.[AN]
[Red]Basic weapons[Red] all perform similarly in[NL]
a fair fight, but you should be aware[AN]
of the qualities of better equipment.[NL]
[Red]Stronger weapons[Red] are more specialized.[AN]
This iron lance [Red]works well against swords,[Red][NL]
but it won't [Red]fare well against axes.[Red][AN]
Keep this in mind as you equip weapons.[AN]
