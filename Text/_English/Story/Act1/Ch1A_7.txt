Blast.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh?[.4] Whatever is the matter, Fernand?[AN]
[MidRight]
I was hoping to have avoided the[NL]
watchman on my way to collect you,[AN]
Clair,[.4] but it seems they've[NL]
prepared for my return.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You were stationed at this fort before[NL]
the Deliverance was founded,[.4] yes?[AN]
You know it better than anyone,[AN]
so I will deign to delegate the task[NL]
of recapturing it to you.[AN]
[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
How generous of you to [0x93]delegate[0x94][NL][OpenEyes]
to someone who outranks you...[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm sorry,[.4] did I hear that correctly?[NL]
I'm sure my brother would LOVE[AN]
to hear about your refusal[NL]
to acknowledge my promotion.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
Sigh...[NL][OpenEyes]
As you wish,[.4] Commander.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Fernand.[NL]
Now,[.4] onward![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
(I will never get used to that...)[AN]

##Ch1_7_LukasAdvice
[MidLeft][LoadFernand]
[MidRight][LoadClair]
[MidRight]
Oh, dear...[NL]
Those brutish brigands![AN]
Taking advantage of a battle to[NL]
hassle those innocent villagers![AN]
[MidLeft]
Worse,[.4] I fear--[.4]they're hirelings.[NL]
Desaix has no qualms about enlisting[AN]
the lowest of ruffians to sow[NL]
chaos and demand tribute.[AN]
[MidRight]
Clearly,[.4] the knightly thing to do[NL]
would be to warn the villagers[AN]
and drive off the bandits![NL]
And I shall gladly volunteer,[AN]
as flying over the river would[NL]
make this a trivial feat.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You may be your brother's sister, Clair,[NL]
but you are still but a tenderfoot.[AN]
Did you not notice[NL]
that ballistician[.4] [LoadOverworldFaces][.4]eagerly eyeing[AN]
some winged bait for his bolt?[AN]
It's too dear a risk for a mere[NL]
ploy of diversion from the true enemy.[AN]
You mustn't wager your[NL]
life (or your mount!) on it.[AN]
[MidRight]
You needn't treat me like[NL]
such a child, Fernand![AN]
I'm quite sure I can find a way to[NL]
arrive there in one piece.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Grrh--[.4] Clair!![NL]
Get back here![AN]
That's an order--[NL]
are you listening?![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadMan1]
[MidLeft]
What?[.4] Bandits?[.4] Well, thank you for[NL]
warning us.[.5] We'll close the gates.[AN]
...And Desaix's men,[.4] too?[NL]
Well,[.4] I don't care much for whatever[AN]
petty horse-plop the nobility are[NL]
fighting about,[.4] but you've done us[AN]
a favor.[.5] The least I can do is give[NL]
you this lance for your trouble.[AN]

##Ch1_7_House
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
[MidRight][LoadOldwoman]
I've heard tell that Emperor Rudolf's[NL]
nephew is visiting Zofia Castle.[AN]
Not only is the lad a general,[AN]
but he's also first in line[NL]
to the Rigelian throne.[AN]
That's due to the Emperor lacking[NL]
children of his own, you see.[AN]
[Beat]I reckon the lad's here to pay[NL]
respects to our departed king.[AN]
Yes, that has to be why...[AN]

Ah,[.4] the Deliverance.[NL]
What a splendid way to[AN]

Die, worms![AN]

[MidLeft]
Night watch again,[.4] Clive?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
You really should try[NL]
to sleep, Fernand.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And you really should delegate the[NL]
watch to less critical personnel.[AN]
[MidRight]
Everyone in turn,[.4] of course.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Are we so short-staffed that you must[NL]
take the watch three nights in a row?[AN]
Make that Python fellow do it,[AN]
if he's to be out at the taverns[NL]
until daybreak otherwise.[AN]
[MidRight]
To be blunt,[.4] I'm occupying my[NL]
newfound waking hours because[AN]
I can't rest easy when I know your mind[NL]
is back in the ashes of your estate.[AN]
[MidLeft]
D-[.4]Don't presume to[NL]
know what I'm--[AN]
[MidRight]
Your temper always burns hot and[NL]
short when you're hurting, Fernand.[AN]
I suppose I'm the only one fool enough[NL]
not to turn back from the flames.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Clive,[.4] you daft,[.4][CloseEyes] daft man...[NL]
[.....]
I can still hear it, [.4]sometimes.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft]
[0x93]Paint the carpets blue[NL]
with their blood![0x94][AN]
The crackling of the blaze,[.4] peeling[NL]
the hardwood walls like candlewax.[AN]
[0x93]Roast them like pigs and[NL]
take back what's ours![0x94][AN]
They took it all--[.4] our silver,[.4][NL]
our dignity,[.4] our home.[AN]
[0x93]Feast on the rich,[NL]
not on their riches![0x94][AN]
Until all that was left[NL]
to take were our lives.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight][Right]
Fernand--[.4] you're here now.[NL]
I'm here.[.5] Stay with me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[.4][HalfCloseEyes]
[Beat]I am[.4] tired,[.4] dear Clive.[NL]
So very, very tired.[AN]
[.4]
I want things the way[NL]
they used to be.[AN]
[Right]
Know this, Fernand.[AN]
No matter what comes,[.4] you will[NL]
always be my sworn brother.[AN]
We'll fight on together,[.4] and this too[NL]
shall pass.[.5] Desaix will fall.[AN]
I only ask for your patience[NL]
a little longer.[AN]

Fernand![.4] No sleeping on[NL]
night watch, now![AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes][MoveMidLeft]
C-[.4]Clair![.4] My,[.4] you certainly[NL]
gave me a fright.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
And an enemy soldier would have[NL]
given a much starker one![AN]
As our deputy commander,[.4] I thought[NL]
you'd know this very basic fact![AN]
Really,[.4] of all the people I'd[NL]
suspect to be shirking night watch,[AN]
you'd be the last I'd--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
--Don't you think I know that?![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand![.4] Oh,[.4] I...[NL]
It's this place,[.4] isn't it.[AN]
Your manor was...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Enough![.4] Spare me the special treatment.[NL]
It's insulting.[AN]
Tell the men we're marching at dawn.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Sigh...[.4][HalfCloseEyes] It really is like treading[NL]
upon eggshells around him lately...[AN]
Say anything to him at all,[.4] and he[NL]
either ignores it or misconstrues it.[AN][CloseEyes]
...It's as if the Fernand we knew[NL]
died along with them.[AN]
