[Left]
Our source said he'd meet us here.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Bah.[.4] He won't show.[AN]
[Left]
I have faith he will.[AN]
House Calathea may not have been[NL]
as close an ally to your house[AN]
as to mine,[AN]
but Sir Zopyrus would never[NL]
betray his oaths.[AN]
[MidRight]
Times are different now, Clive--[.4]I don't[NL]
think Fernand's concern is unwarranted.[AN]
Sir Zopyrus's information could turn[NL]
the tides of our campaign,[.4] certainly,[AN]
but we can't discard all caution[NL]
based on his reputation alone.[AN]
[Left]
...I hate to think it.[NL]
But perhaps you have a point.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You were always the[NL]
smarter of the two of us.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'll keep watch while you[NL]
handle the negotiations.[AN]
Best of luck, my love.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Fernand,[.4] what's that look about?[AN]
[FarLeft]
...It's nothing.[NL]
Maybe she's correct.[AN]
[Left]
I'll admit,[.4] I'm relieved to[NL]
see you agree for once.[AN]
You've both been clashing[NL]
more than usual of late.[AN]
It's had me concerned.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Never mind me.[NL]
The Calathean envoy approaches.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well met, Sir Clive.[AN]
[Left]
Sir Zopyrus,[.4] thank you[NL]
for meeting us here.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Quite the scar you've earned[NL]
since last we met.[AN]
[Left]
Fernand![.4] Manners.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes...[.4] Regrettably,[NL]
I clashed with Desaix's forces[AN]
shortly after I sent word to you.[AN]
[Left]
So you know of their[NL]
latest movements,[.4] then?[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed...[.4] I've received word that[NL]
they're in this very fortress![AN]

[MidRight]
Clive![.4] It was a setup.[NL]
This doesn't look good.[AN]
I'd estimate there's about four[NL]
times as many men as we have.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see. [Beat]Against such numbers,[NL]
words like [0x93]bleak[0x94] spring to mind.[AN]
Especially with Lukas and Clair[NL]
stationed at the Southern Outpost,[AN]
we're particularly shorthanded.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hope is not lost,[.4] my love.[AN]
There are a few points of exit[NL]
we can consider,[.4] and the two halves[AN]
of the building are not connected,[NL]
which limits their reinforcements.[AN]
If we stay in close formation and[NL]
make good use of our archers,[AN]
we'll be able to break through.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[.4] I do hope so.[AN]
[MidRight]
What is it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Nothing.[.4] Just thinking how[NL]
lucky I am to have you.[AN]
Your confidence gives me strength.[AN]
[MidRight]
Flattery will get you everywhere.[NL]
I'll tell the others of the plan.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you.[AN]

Look![.4] Over the berm--[NL]
more cavalry.[AN]
Strong and well-equipped...[NL]
And approaching fast,[.4] too.[AN]
[Left]
We don't have the[NL]
numbers to take them![AN]
We need to return to[NL]
the hideout and regroup.[AN]
[FarLeft]
They'll pin us against the[NL]
fortress walls at this rate![AN]
[MidRight]
I'll distract them.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Mathilda,[.4] no![.4] What if--[AN]
[MidRight]
I'll be fine,[.4] Clive.[NL]
Trust in my abilities.[.4] Go![AN]
