Not so fast.[NL]
Where do ya think yer goin'?[AN]
Don't y'know whose halls these is?[AN]

Huh?[.4] But I thought this was the--[AN]

[FarFarLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
That's enough, Python.[AN]
There's no call to play at[NL]
trickery with our new recruits.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh![.4] Lukas, you ginger stud.[NL]
You still draw breath.[AN]
I was worried Desaix's dogs might have[NL]
punched your ticket to the boneyard.[AN]
So this sack of guts here[NL]
must be Sir Grandson.[AN]
[Left]
Yes, he's the one.[NL]
Is Sir Clive about?[AN]
[MidRight]
Better shake your tail feathers.[NL]
He's been waiting for you.[AN]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight]
Oh hey, kid![NL]
I almost forgot.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hm?[.4] What is it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Terrors roam these halls.[NL]
You'd best tread carefully.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Terrors?![.4] What are monsters like[NL]
those doing in your hideout?[AN]
[MidRight]
To be fair, they technically[NL]
got here first.[AN]
We're just sort of[Beat][....][NL]
borrowing their catacombs.[AN]
Plus, Terrors rise in bigger groups[NL]
the closer you get to Mila's power.[AN]
Cutting 'em down only makes room[NL]
for new ones, so we just let 'em be.[AN]
[....][ToggleSmile]
Why the long face, stud?[AN]
Don't think you can handle a few[NL]
creepie-crawlies?[ToggleSmile] 'Cause if not,[AN]
I dunno how you're planning to[NL]
fight for the Deliverance.[AN]
[.....]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Aw, I'm just japin' ya.[NL]
Get going, yeah?[AN]
Oh, and hold your nose--[NL]
Terrors stink.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes][....]
Great[Beat] Their hideout is guarded[NL]
by an army of the dead[Beat][AN]

It gladdens me to see you safe![NL]
I couldn't bear to lose you[AN]
on top of everything else[NL]
we have sacrificed.[AN][OpenEyes]
[Right][MoveLeft]
[Left]
You look so pale, Clive. Forgive me.[NL]
You must have been worried sick.[AN]
But I'm all right.[AN]
Alm and the others arrived before[NL]
true ill could befall me.[AN]
[MidRight]
[MidRight]
And you must be Alm.[.5] I've been[NL]
looking forward to this meeting.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Y-yes, sir.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hahaha.[.4] Please, be at ease.[AN]
Such formalities are not[NL]
required here.[AN]
You saved the life of my dear sister.[NL]
This makes you a friend.[AN]
My name is Clive.[AN]
And as you must already know,[NL]
I lead the Deliverance.[AN][NL]
It's good to meet you, Alm.[AN]
[FarLeft]
L-likewise, Clive.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I can't believe it.[NL]
That's THE Clive![AN]
In the flesh and everything![AN]
[MidRight]
What, is he famous or something?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin![NL]
I am sorely disappointed in you.[AN]
Sir Clive captains the[NL]
Knights of Zofia![AN]
He's the finest knight[NL]
in all the realm![AN]
Seriously, man.[.5] Read a book.[AN]
[MidRight]
OK, OK.[.4] He's clearly a big deal.[AN]
But then why is the[NL]
[0x93]finest knight in all the realm[0x94][AN]
LOSING the war?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, he's obviously[Beat][AN]
I mean, he[Beat][.......][NL]
Shut up, Tobin.[AN]

[Left]
How have we been faring, Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
Not well, I fear.[.5] We lost many[NL]
good men when the outpost fell.[AN]
...Too many.[AN]
The morale of our troops[NL]
has taken an ill turn in kind.[AN]
I was hoping Sir Mycen could[NL]
re-ignite their courage, but[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft]
Please don't judge my grandfather.[NL]
I know he had his reasons.[AN]
Even if I don't know what they are.[AN]
But I promise you that I'll fight[NL]
every bit as hard as he would have.[AN]
[Beat]Or harder![.4] I just don't want[NL]
you to think[Beat] I mean, he's not--[AN]
[MidRight]
Peace, Alm.[.5] I understand.[AN]
None here would dare think[NL]
your grandfather craven.[AN]
That being said, I would beg[NL]
a boon of you.[AN]
The same one I had hoped to ask[NL]
of Sir Mycen, in fact.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Please, go on.[.5] If it's[NL]
within my power, I'll do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then I shall state it plain.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
I would like you to become the[NL]
new leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
WHAAAT?![.4] I mean[Beat]um[Beat]what?[NL]
I'm not a leader![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadFernand]
[FarLeft]
Clive![.4] Have you taken leave[NL]
of your senses?[AN]
[MidRight]
This needs to happen, Fernand.[NL]
You know it as well as I.[AN]
Most of our volunteers are[NL]
of common birth.[AN]
We share a cause, but little else.[AN]
I know not how to speak[NL]
to their hearts.[AN]
Sir Mycen began as a common soldier[NL]
before rising to a knight and count.[AN]
His story resonates with these people.[AN]
Do you not agree that his grandson is[NL]
just the banner they would rally to?[AN]
[FarLeft]
What fool would agree with that?![AN]
If some ungrateful peasant won't[NL]
heed your command,[AN]
you sweep him aside![AN]
[MidRight]
Think, Fernand![.4] Our finest knight[NL]
is now a prisoner of war.[AN]
To fill the gap she left behind,[AN]
can we truly afford to turn away[NL]
able soldiers?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ngh[Beat][AN]
[Left]
I, for one, think[NL]
it's a fine idea.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You too...?![AN]
[Left]
Knights have no monopoly on skill,[NL]
and Alm is as able a fighter as any.[AN]
Clive has done all he can to hold[NL]
the Deliverance together thus far,[AN]
but if our ship is astray,[NL]
then we must chart a new course.[AN]
Alm is that course.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What, do you fancy yourself[NL]
Clive's new confidant now?![AN]
I'll rip that traitorous tongue[NL]
from your throat![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Then you'll finally have[NL]
the truth in your grasp![AN]
I lost friends at the Outpost.[NL]
Veteran men, yet dead all the same.[AN]
We MUST adapt so we might end this[NL]
war as quickly as possible.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

Please, just[Beat]hold on a second.[AN]
I know I said I would do anything[NL]
in my power, but I can't--[AN]
[MidRight]
I understand what you can[NL]
and cannot do, Alm.[AN]
My lieutenants and I would continue[NL]
to handle day-to-day affairs.[AN]
We only need you to do one thing:[NL]
lead.[AN]
You would be inspiring the troops[NL]
and revitalizing the army.[AN]
You are Sir Mycen's grandson.[NL]
I know you to be capable of such.[AN]
[Left]
I'm not so sure[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft][LoadClair]
[FarLeft]
Please, Alm.[.5] For me.[NL]
For all of us.[AN]
My brother tries to hide it,[AN]
but I know the anxiety of Mathilda's[NL]
capture takes a toll on him.[AN]
You can relieve him of at least[NL]
a portion of that burden.[AN]
[Left]
I want to, but[Beat][AN]
[Beat] [Beat][NL]
[Beat]All right.[AN]
If you think me worthy,[NL]
then I won't let you down.[AN]
[MidRight]
Are you certain?[AN]
Then thank you, Alm.[NL]
Thank you.[AN]
[Left]
Just[Beat] please, keep your[NL]
expectations low.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha! As you wish.[AN]
[FarLeft]
This could change everything[Beat][AN]
The boy will make a splendid[NL]
leader![.4] Simply splendid![AN]

##DeliveranceHideout_CGText_3

I only joined this damned army[NL]
because YOU were leading it![AN]
Now you want me to take orders[NL]

This is no mere farmchild.[NL]
He has Sir Mycen's blood![AN]

Pah! Damn that Mycen[NL]
AND his common blood![AN]
Nobility cannot be [0x93]earned[0x94]--[AN]
nor can it be passed down[NL]
to some mongrel grandchild![AN]
You are far too soft[NL]
to lead this army, Clive,[AN]
and I've lost my taste[NL]
for it long ago.[AN]
[MidRight]
You know as well as I that[NL]
we are both too deep in grief[AN]
to captain the Deliverance ourselves.[AN]
I KNOW I cannot lead--[.4]which is why[NL]
we must take this chance.[AN]
[Left]
How can you still call it[NL]
the [0x93]Deliverance[0x94]?![AN]
We were supposed to be[NL]
a band of noble knights.[AN]
United in purpose![NL]
Upholding a tradition![AN]
Restoring the old order to Zofia![AN]
Now we have nothing but a militia[AN]
full of baseborn serfs[NL]
trying to lord over us.[AN]
Like your lieutenant Forsyth.[AN]
Or that Python--[NL]
true to his name, he is![AN]
[MidRight]
They have both proven themselves[NL]
on the battlefield time and again![AN]
Are you suggesting I deny my men[NL]
reward for their achievements?[AN]
What morale would they have then?![NL]
The damned army wouldn't function![AN]
Hear me, Fernand.[.5] Hear me well.[AN]
I know you have your reasons for[NL]
closing your heart to common folk.[AN]
But please, for the sake of our[NL]
ideals, you MUST think past them.[AN]
[Left][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
No, Clive.[.5] I will not.[NL]
I would rather die than kneel[AN]
to some whelp who was[NL]
birthed in the hay.[AN]
Today we part ways for good.[AN]
I am finished with you[NL]
and your [0x93]Deliverance.[0x94][AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveFarLeft][FarLeft]
Farewell.[AN]

we've had no shortage of clashes.[AN][....][OpenEyes]
I cannot force him to[NL]

Well, perhaps it's[NL]
better this way.[AN]

the way of comfort, but[Beat][AN]
I'll do my best.[AN]
