Watch out.[.5] That archer is[NL]
carrying a powerful bow.[AN]
We should only send in capable--[NL]

units to deal with him.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
What pigs![AN]
Relegating me to this rat-infested[NL]
hellhole like some baseborn serf![AN]
They'll rue the day my brother[NL]
hears of this, that's for sure![AN]
Surely he must be the one who has[NL]
sent these saviors to open my cell.[AN]

Clair![.4] You're unharmed?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, Lukas![.4] You came to rescue me?[NL]
How simply gallant of you.[AN]
I was tiring of these[NL]
unseemly accomodations.[AN]
You'd think these soldiers would know[NL]
how to treat a proper noblewoman![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm glad to see you in your[NL]
usual spirits,[.4] at least.[AN]
How fare the survivors of[NL]
your battalion?[AN]
[MidRight]
They're unharmed, as well,[NL]
in the cells below ground.[AN]
Would you be so gallant as to[NL]
rescue them,[.4] too?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Certainly.[.4] But we'll need your[NL]
help to retake this fort.[AN]
[MidRight]
That sounds lovely,[.4] but they've[NL]
confiscated my weapon and hidden it[AN]
somewhere here.[.5] So I'm afraid I'm[NL]
currently unarmed.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It may not be up to your standards,[NL]
but I did bring a spare.[AN]
Take this lance--[.4]but be cautious.[NL]
There are archers about.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, pish-posh![.5] I know how to[NL]
handle myself on the battlefield.[AN]
Don't fall behind,[.4] now![AN]

You're Clair,[.4] right?[AN]

Er-[.4]hem![.4] The boy will show[NL]
more respect than THAT.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Uh...[.5] Right,[.4] look,[.4] we're here to rescue[NL]
the captured Deliverance forces,[AN]
so do you mind if we save the[NL]
formalities for later?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh![.4] In that case,[.4] I suppose I'll[NL]
let it slide.[.5] I'd love to help,[AN]
but I'm afraid they've confiscated[NL]
my weapons and hidden them in this fort.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, it isn't much,[.4] but Lukas had a spare[NL]
lying around.[.5] Think you can use this?[AN]
[MidRight]
That'll do just fine![.5] Now let us show[NL]
these brutes what-for![.5] Don't tarry, now![AN]

Well met to you too.[NL]
Now if you'll excuse me,[AN]
I'm currently preoccupied with standing[NL]
around unarmed on a battlefield?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh![.4] Right--[.4]that's pretty dangerous.[AN]
Well,[.4] it's only gentlemanly of me[NL]
to offer you my lance,[.4] then?[AN]
With this weapon,[.4] I swear I shall[NL]

Lukas, you have my thanks.[NL]

This is Alm.[.4] He recently joined[NL]
us in the Deliverance.[AN]

Oh![.4] Well,[.4] how simply lovely.[NL]
Welcome![.4] I am Clair.[AN]
The young man may address me as[NL]

Uh[Beat] pleasure to meet you, milady.[AN]

So![.4] From where do you hail, Alm?[AN]

I,[.4] um[Beat] [0x93]hail[0x94] from a little[NL]
place called Ram Village.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]

A village![.4] You don't say![.4] My,[NL]
I hardly ever speak to villagers![AN]
Well,[.4] you aren't smothered in manure,[AN]

Clair,[.4] perhaps you should consider[NL]
Alm's feelings in regards to his home.[AN]
[MidRight]
His[Beat] huh?[.4] Oh dear,[NL]
have I done it again?[AN]
It's as Clive constantly reminds me:[AN]
[0x93]The Deliverance is not like[NL]
the Knights of Zofia.[AN]
Not every soldier[NL]
in our ranks is noble,[AN]
but we must treat them[NL]
all as equals.[0x94][AN]
The peasant must forgive his lady[NL]
for this gauche breach of etiquette.[AN]
[Left]
It's all right.[.5] The peasant--[NL]
whose name is Alm, by the way--[AN]
will get over it.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh,[.4] Alm![.4] I can see you are[NL]
truly kind.[AN]
Might I ask you more about[NL]
your village later?[AN]
I'm ever so curious![AN]
[Left]
Of course.[AN]
[MidRight]
Splendid![.4] I've always wanted to[NL]
know more about cows and pigs[AN]
and sheep and such...[AN]
