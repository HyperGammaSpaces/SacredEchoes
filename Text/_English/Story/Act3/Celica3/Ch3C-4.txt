## Ch3_4C_OpeningText_SonyaChosen
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
So, we face Sonya today...[AN]
They say she is a powerful mage, who[NL]
wields the Excalibur spell with ease.[AN]
It's a deadly wind spell that[NL]
easily hits weak points.[AN]
With an Angel Ring, we might[NL]
stand a chance...[AN]
Otherwise, we should try[NL]
to out-range her.[AN]

## Ch3_4C_OpeningText_DeenChosen
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
So, we face Deen today...[AN]
I wasn't able to learn much about him,[NL]
aside from his weapon of choice.[AN]
It's a deadly blade that[NL]
easily hits weak points.[AN]
With an Angel Ring, we might[NL]
stand a chance...[AN]
Otherwise, we should try[NL]
to out-range him.[AN]

## Ch3_4C_OpeningText_SonyaChosen_Catria
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
So, we face Sonya today...[AN]
Catria, were you able to find any[NL]
information about her?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCatria]
We haven't had to face her before,[NL]
so I don't know how involved she is[AN]
with Grieth's kidnappings.[NL]
I've heard tell that she's Rigelian.[AN]
She's an experienced mage who wields[NL]
the Excalibur spell.[AN]
I brought the Angel Ring in preparation[NL]
to face its tendency to hit weak spots.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see...[.4] Good planning, Catria.[AN]
We shouldn't take the risk of only[NL]
relying on the Angel Ring, though.[AN]
We'll provide support at range,[NL]
to avoid taking a hit at all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Understood. It's a shame we have to[NL]
face her, but if she's standing[AN]
between me and my sister...[NL]
it's a duty I must do.[AN]

So, we face Deen today...[AN]
[MidRight][LoadAtlas][MoveMidRight]
Hey,[.4] I know that guy![.4] Well, I mean,[NL]
sort of.[.4] I heard stories in the army.[AN]
There was a guy named Deen that served[NL]
under my commander a few years back.[AN]
Apparently something bad happened[NL]
back home while he was deployed,[AN]
and he never showed back up.[NL]
To be honest,[.4] I don't blame him.[AN]
After what happened with my brothers[NL]
while I was deployed,[AN]
I'm not going back either.[AN]
[Beat][MoveMidRight]Rrgh![.4] Dammit![.4] Now I'm having my[NL]
doubts about fighting this guy![AN]
But he made the choice to get between[NL]
me and my brothers,[.4] so...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Atlas, wait--[.4]before you rush in, do you[NL]
know anything of his fighting style?[AN]
[MidRight]
Huh?[.4] Uhh...[.4] Not really.[AN]
Well,[.4] I know he's got this fancy sword.[NL]
Real good at hitting weak points.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmm...[.4] In that case,[.4] we'd better[NL]
have plenty of ranged support.[AN]
Your axe won't fare well against[NL]
a swordsman like that.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
I can use a bow![AN]
[Beat]Well,[.4] I don't know if I can[NL]
hit much with it just yet.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Right,[.4] just...[.4] Promise me you won't[NL]
try to fight him by yourself.[AN]
Grieth's the real problem here.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah...[.4] Yeah, you're right![.4] I'll save my[NL]
beating for the guy who deserves it![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadSonya]
Naughty children.[AN]
You ought never have[NL]
made an enemy of Grieth.[AN]
Still,[.4] this is mere[NL]
business for my part.[AN]
No hard feelings,[.4] I pray.[AN]

[Beat][AN]
Mother Mila,[.4] please forgive your[NL]
faithful servant for taking the life[AN]
of an honorable opponent.[AN]
May your grace guide this soul[NL]
to find peace with you.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadSaber]
You all right, lass?[.5] First time[NL]
I've heard you pray like that.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Every time prior we've slain a foe,[AN]
it was in defense of ourselves[NL]
or of innocent lives.[AN]
...It's just[Beat] shaken me a bit[AN]
to turn my blade on someone whose[NL]
only crime was standing in my way.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's what the path of the sword[NL]
leads to, lass.[.4] Sooner or later,[AN]
it happens to everyone who wields it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I know.[AN]
I can't help but wonder if Alm[NL]
has known this pain yet.[AN]
If he's felt the weight of[NL]
lost lives upon his shoulders.[AN]
...I wish I could protect him from it,[N]
but[Beat] I don't know if I could bear[NL]
to look at him if he didn't.[AN]
[MidRight]
The kid from the castle?[NL]
What's he got to do with this?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
...You're right.[.4] We've got much[NL]
more pressing matters to focus on.[AN]
The hostages within Grieth's keep[NL]
are depending on us![AN]

[MidRight][LoadDeen]
Hm.[.4] She's down.[AN]
Well, that's a group we've got[NL]
no business messing with.[AN]
Men, you're free to go.[AN]
No point sticking around[NL]
this desert now.[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_4C_EndingText_SonyaRetreats
[MidRight][LoadSonya]
Oh?[.4] Deen's been defeated?[AN]
Well, clearly this group's not one[NL]
whose bad side we should be on.[AN]
If they can take Deen, they'll have[NL]
no trouble with Grieth.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Ladies, stand down.[.4] Let's see[NL]
how this plays out.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadOldwoman]
This place used to be a grassy steppe,[NL]
full of horses and sheep.[AN]
But when the rains dried up,[NL]
the plant life soon followed.[AN]
Now the terrain's too difficult[NL]
for hoofed animals to navigate.[AN]
Even humans have a hard time[NL]
without the right shoes.[AN]
Those with [Red]magical ability[Red], though,[NL]
can glide across the sand[AN]
as if it's not even there![AN]
It's as if the spirits[NL]
guide their feet.[AN]

One time I was playing near[NL]
the bones,[.4] and I tripped![AN]
I didn't cry.[.4] Promise![AN]
But I found a cool thing[NL]
in the sand I kicked up.[AN]
Maybe there's some more.[AN]
