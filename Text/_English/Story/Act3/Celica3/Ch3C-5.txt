Like myself,[.4] Lady Liprica was[NL]
a sister in the service[AN]
of Mother Mila.[AN]
But all that ended once[NL]
King Lima's royal procession[AN]
arrived at the temple.[AN]
Lady Liprica's beauty caught[NL]
his eye,[.4] and she was stolen away[AN]
in the night.[AN]
He took her to his castle and[NL]
forced her to join his seraglio[AN]
of countless brides.[AN]
Despite the luxury,[.4] I expect[NL]
life in the castle proved[AN]
most difficult for her.[AN]

Lady Liprica also left something[NL]
for you,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]

For me?[AN]

Aye,[.4] milady.[.5] It is a circlet[NL]

She asked that this be given to you[NL]
once you were of age.[AN]

A circlet...?[NL][MoveMidLeft]
You can't mean the royal crown?![AN]
Surely my mother had cause to hate[NL]
the monarchy above all else?[AN]

I fear I know not what her[NL]
intentions were,[.4] milady.[AN]
Nor have I the means of asking now.[NL]

I know a time will come when your[NL]
mother's heart grows clear to you.[AN]
