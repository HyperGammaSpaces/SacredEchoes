[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
How...[.4] Who told you that?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, lemme think a second...[NL]
Who could it have been?[AN]
You know what? It don't matter.[NL]
Fact is, I owe you my thanks.[AN]
While you royals were lounging about[NL]
ignoring your own kingdom,[AN]
I was becoming a VERY RICH MAN![AN]
You people turned Zofia into a place[NL]
where only the strong survive.[AN]
Hell, now it's the spitting image[NL]
of Rigel itself, don'cha think?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You may think yourself something fine...[NL]
but your days as a predator are done.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
I see cells just ahead--[.4]this keep[NL]
must be where the prisoners are held.[AN]
Grates! I command you to unlock![AN]
[MidRight][LoadIrma]
I owe you thanks beyond measure[NL]
for saving me. My name is Irma,[AN]
and I serve at the Temple of Mila.[NL]
...Or did, I suppose.[AN]
In truth, this place has been my[NL]
only home for many a long year.[AN]
I fear greatly what may have[NL]
transpired at the temple...[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you're an attendant to Mila?[AN]
Interesting... We're actually making[NL]
our way to the temple right now.[AN]
[MidRight]
Is that so? Then might I ask--[NL]
By the Mother! Are you...?[AN][CloseEyes]
No, you couldn't be...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Er, I'm sorry?[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Ah...[.4] F-[.4]forgive me.[AN]
It's just that you bear a striking[NL]
resemblance to Lady Liprica.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft]
Liprica?[.4] That's...[.4] my mother's name.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Then it's true![.4] You're her![NL]
You're Princess Anthiese![AN][MoveMidRight]
Mila be praised, you're alive![AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Are you saying you know my mother?![AN]
Please, you... you must tell me[NL]
anything you can about her.[AN]
I never had a chance[NL]
to know her, you see...[AN]
[MidRight]
It would be an honor, Your Highness.[NL]
Where shall I begin...?[AN]

[SetName]Irma[NL]
Like myself, Lady Liprica was[NL]
a sister in the service[AN]
of Mother Mila.[AN]
But all that ended once[NL]
King Lima's royal procession[AN]
arrived at the temple.[AN]
Lady Liprica's beauty caught[NL]
his eye, and she was stolen away[AN]
in the night.[AN]
He took her to his castle and[NL]
forced her to join his seraglio[AN]
of countless brides.[AN]
Despite the luxury, I expect[NL]
life in the castle proved[AN]
most difficult for her.[AN]
She soon took ill, and left[NL]
this world shortly after[AN]
bearing Your Highness.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica][CloseEyes]
Mother...[AN]
[MidRight]
I am so very sorry, Princess Anthiese.[AN]
But I would implore you to[NL]
spare your tears.[AN]
Lady Liprica thought only of your health[NL]
and happiness until her final breath.[AN]
Lady Liprica also left some things[NL]
for you, Your Highness.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
For me?[AN]
[MidRight]
Aye, milady.[.4] They are a circlet and a[NL]
sword that prove your royal standing.[AN]
She asked that these be given to you[NL]
once you were of age.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A circlet...?[NL][MoveMidLeft]
You can't mean the royal crown?![AN]
Surely my mother had cause to hate[NL]
the monarchy above all else?[AN]
[MidRight]
I fear I know not what her[NL]
intentions were, milady.[AN]
Nor have I the means of asking now.[NL]
But, Your Highness...[AN]
I know a time will come when your[NL]
mother's heart grows clear to you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.4]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidRight]
The circlet and sword are[NL]
stored in the temple vault.[AN]
I shall make my way there now.[AN]
I must tell everyone that Her Highness[NL]
Anthiese has returned to us![AN]
I will await your arrival at the temple.[NL]
May Mila's blessing be upon you always.[AN]

You're our savior, m'lady![AN]
From this point on, I am yours[NL]

Now, want me to bust the skulls of any[NL]
of Grieth's men we might'a missed?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
N-no, that's...[AN]
Thank you, Atlas, but I don't[NL]
think that'll be necessary.[AN]
Why don't you two go spend some[NL]
time with your family instead?[AN]
[FarRight]
I give it five minutes before we're[NL]
punching each other's lights out,[AN]
but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't[NL]
missed them loads![AN]
[Right][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]
Hey, dolt! I'm the only one allowed to[NL]
knock sense into those kids' heads![AN]
How 'bout I knock some into yours[NL]

the three of you are all right.[AN]

I'd really like to hurry home, but... [AN]
Well, it wouldn't be right to run off[NL]
before thanking you for your help.[AN]

Ah, so you're Deen.[NL]
We owe you thanks.[AN]
Had you pursued us,[NL]
we couldn't have defeated Grieth.[AN]
Your restraint was much appreciated.[AN]

Heh.[.5] Quite the gamble.[NL]
Fortunately, it paid off.[AN]

that's how I would react.[AN]
Quite the clever one, aren't you?[NL]

Still, I'll wager your friends[NL]
