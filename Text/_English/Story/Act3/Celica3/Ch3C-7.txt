Has the temple already fallen[NL]

What have they done to the Mother?[NL]

Who are you?[AN]

I am Mikhail, cantor[NL]
of the Duma Faithful.[AN]
I have come to teach Duma's greatness[NL]
to the fools who cling to Mila's lies.[AN]
Now, rue your ignorance from inside[NL]
the bellies of my gargoyles![AN]
[FarLeft]
...Take care, everyone. He's a cantor--[AN]
he's likely to summon forth some[NL]
manner of terrible beast.[AN]
Stick close and watch each other's[NL]

Nomah? What in the world[NL]
are you doing here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not to put too fine a point on it,[NL]
but I was worried about you.[AN]
I followed you as far as this temple,[NL]
but this place is just so LARGE![AN]
I'm embarrassed to say I got a bit[NL]
lost, little one. Heh heh heh![AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Oh, dear.[.4] I'm glad those[NL]
priestesses were there to guide you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Indeed.[.4] I see we've some troublemakers[NL]

Might I fight alongside you from here on?[AN]
Perhaps we'd both enjoy more peace[NL]

Yeah, but look at the temple.[NL]

I always thought it would be[NL]
crazy beautiful, you know?[AN]
I mean, Mila can't ACTUALLY live[NL]

I beg forgiveness,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
I had no idea the temple fell[NL]

They took Mila.[AN]
It's unthinkable.[.4] They're no knights--[NL]
only blasphemers and thieves![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
The Rigelians hold Mila captive?![NL]
You're certain of this?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am,[.4] Your Highness.[NL]
Emperor Rudolf led the charge himself.[AN]
Sealed her powers and took her away.[AN]

Now, hold on just a tick.[AN]
We get to the temple and[NL]
everything's taken care of.[AN]
That was the deal.[AN]

Unfortunately,[.4] none of us expected[NL]
the Mother to have stepped out.[AN]
Nothing like this has[NL]
ever happened before.[AN]

Well,[.4] I guess now we know why[NL]
the soil's gone barren.[AN]
It's been cut off from Mila's bounty.[AN]

[Beat] What do we do now, milady?[AN]
[Left][OpenEyes]
The only thing we can.[NL]
We find the Mother and bring her back.[AN]

Uh,[.4] please take this as[NL]
kindly as possible, milady,[.4] but...[AN][MoveMidRight]
Are you MAD?![.4] How exactly do we[NL]
[0x93]bring her back[0x94]?[.4] And from where?![AN]
[Left]
I don't know.[AN]
But if the Rigelian Army took her,[NL]
she'll be somewhere in the empire.[AN]
And since we've already[NL]
come to the border...[AN]
Well,[.4] we might as well[NL]
continue into Rigel.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold on just a moment.[NL]
You're saying we INVADE Rigel?[AN][MoveMidRight]
This isn't a motley band of[NL]
pirates or thieves--[AN]
it's an entire empire of them![AN]
We should all take a step back[NL]
and consider our opti--[AN]
[Left]
No amount of thinking will change[NL]
the situation.[.4] Come, Boey.[AN]
This isn't the first time we've[NL]
faced hopeless odds.[AN]
And when people told us to give up,[NL]
did we run?[AN]
We need to trust in our abilities.[NL]
We've come this far for a reason.[AN]
And that reason is restoring Mila[NL]

She's still the only one who can[NL]

I bear the royal circlet[NL]

Are you prepared to[NL]
accept it, Princess?[AN]
[Left]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
This is no mere memento of your mother.[AN]
It is a crown--[.4]and accepting it[NL]
is a kind of coronation.[AN]
As princess of Zofia,[.4] are you prepared[NL]
to wear this and ascend the throne?[AN]
[Left]
I[Beat] I'm afraid I know little of[NL]
kingdoms or the scope of rule.[AN]
I thought my life would be better spent[NL]
serving my people as a priestess[AN]
than being served as their princess.[AN]
But I have people I wish to protect.[NL]
Both here and elsewhere.[AN]
If I may use the power of the crown[NL]
to serve and protect,[.4] I shall do so.[AN]
I wish for this by my will alone.[NL]
For my own happiness.[AN]
Is that resolve enough?[AN]
[MidRight]
It is indeed. [.4][ToggleSmile]Princess Anthiese.[AN]
By the authority the Mother has vested[NL]
in me,[.4] this crown is now yours to bear.[AN]

That...![.5] Sir Knight,[.4] that is[NL]
a fragment of the sword the Mother[AN]
gave to her most beloved hero...[NL]
the queen for whom Zofia is named![AN]
[Right]
It is of a rare and magical metal.[AN]
No doubt the invaders sought it[NL]
for some nefarious purpose.[AN]
I sustained these wounds intercepting[NL]
them as they fled the temple with it.[AN]
[FarRight]
It would be of little use to[NL]
the Rigelians,[.4] mercifully.[AN]
Only the fire of Ragnarok,[AN]

can heat this blade.[AN]
