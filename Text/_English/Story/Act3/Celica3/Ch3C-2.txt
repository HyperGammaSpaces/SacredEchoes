Oh, great...[.5] Another graveyard[NL]
filled with even MORE Terrors...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Oh, grow a spine already![AN]
So what if those guys[NL]
sprout up like weeds?[AN]
It's perfect target practice![AN]
After this little warm-up,[NL]
we can storm the Temple of Mila[AN]
with spells blazin'![AN]
[MidRight]
Why would we want to[NL]
storm the temple...?[AN]

To reach the Temple of Mila, cross the[NL]
valley approach and continue north.[AN]
The temple's more than just a place of[NL]
worship for the goddess, you know--[AN]
it also defends the sluice gate[NL]
at the kingdom's border.[AN]
However, the gate opens only to[NL]
members of the Zofian royal family.[AN]
With His Highness Lima IV gone,[NL]
the sluice may lie closed forever...[AN]

After losing my husband to the plague[NL]
that hit our village, I fell apart.[AN]
My son felt he had to help me.[NL]
I tried to stop him, but it was no use.[AN]
He left for the Dragon Shrine in order[NL]
to find the Well of Revival.[AN]
They said it can give life to the dead,[NL]
so he seeks to return my husband.[AN]
Though I fear I'm more like to lose[NL]
a son than reclaim a husband.[AN]
That shrine is a horror of a place.[NL]
I won't let my son die there.[AN]

I tried my hand at carving[NL]
a likeness of Duma.[AN]
Figured maybe his blessing would help[NL]
me chop through the forest, yeah?[AN]
And it WORKED![NL]
When I'm holding it,[AN]
I can feel strength surging[NL]
through my chopping arm![AN]
Though, I've noticed way more Terrors[NL]
showing up in this here valley...[AN]
D'you think I carved his image wrong?[NL]
Now I'm worried...[.5] [MoveMidLeft]O Duma! Forgive me![AN]
Take this and bury it somewhere[NL]
for me, will you...?[AN]

This is dire.[.5] I'd heard tell that[NL]
the closer one gets to Mila's power,[AN]
the greater in strength and number[NL]
the Terrors that spawn are.[AN]
[MidRight]
As harsh as it is that they've[NL]
chosen to rise so close to a town,[AN]
I wouldn't say it's dire.[AN]
It means there is still hope.[NL]
Mila is still there.[.5] I can feel it.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I'd...[.5] hate to think about how[NL]
many more we'll be seeing.[AN][OpenEyes]
Not that I won't fulfill my duty[NL]
to serve and protect you, of course![AN]
[MidRight]
You don't have to put on[NL]
a brave face for me, Boey.[AN]
I know your feelings on Terrors.[AN]
The fact that you've agreed[NL]
to face them with me[AN]
is proof enough of your bravery.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wh-[.4]what feelings?![NL]
I'm not scared of Terrors![AN]
Not at all![AN]
B-But if I WAS...[.5] then I'd really[NL]
appreciate what you're saying.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hee hee.[.5] You're welcome, Boey.[AN]

Hey! Lady! Wait up![AN]
I didn't get a chance to[NL]
thank you properly![AN]
[MidRight]
Oh? You must be from the village...[AN]
[Left]
Sure are.[.5] I'm Atlas, and this is[NL]
my brother Hyas.[AN]
We don't get a lot of outsiders here.[NL]
What brings you?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am just a humble priestess on a[NL]
pilgrimage to the Temple of Mila.[AN]
Though...[.5] I've planned a detour to[NL]
the desert southwest of here.[AN]
There's someone we're looking to[NL]
rescue in Grieth's stronghold.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveFarLeft]
Wow, priestess![AN]
You've gotta be either bold as hell[NL]
or dumb as a rock[AN]
to go up against THAT guy.[AN]
[Left]
Lucky for you, we're both![AN][ToggleSmile]
And we've got a score to[NL]
settle with him, too.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We've got three younger brothers,[NL]
and Grieth kidnapped all of them![AN]
He raided this village while my[NL]
big bro was deployed on the frontier.[AN]
I wasn't strong enough to take[NL]
all those guys at once...[AN]
[Left]
I want to tear that thief's head[NL]
clean off his body![AN]
But the two of us alone can't do it.[AN]
If you're headed to the desert,[NL]
let us come and have our revenge.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course.[NL]
Glad to have your assistance.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Let's mow 'em down![AN]

Hey! You a priestess?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am.[.5] Do you need my services?[AN]
[Left]
I was off fighting on the frontier[NL]
until a short while ago.[AN]
Came home to find my village in ruins[NL]
and my brothers taken by Grieth.[AN]
I want to tear that thief's head[NL]
clean off his body![AN]
...But I can't do it alone.[AN]
Are you going to Grieth's stronghold?[NL]
Let me come and have my revenge.[AN]
[MidRight]
As a matter of fact, we are.[NL]
May I have your name, sir?[AN]
[Left]
I'm Atlas.[NL][ToggleSmile]
You need anything lifted, I'm your man.[AN]
[MidRight]
How apt.[.5] My name is Celica.[NL]
Glad to have your assistance.[AN]

Let's mow 'em down![AN]

Now hold on a moment, lass.[AN]
Didn't Mr. Mask tell you NOT[NL]
to go bothering that stronghold[AN]
in the desert? He went and told us[NL]
the safest route to the temple.[AN]
You sure you don't want to take it?[AN]
[MidRight]
I can't stand idly by while this[NL]
Grieth makes so many people suffer.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, I don't know a whole lot[NL]
about matters of faith, but...[AN]
Wouldn't finding this goddess of yours[NL]
put a stop to men like Grieth?[AN]
Surely if he's as bad as rumor has it,[NL]
she'd have the means to just smite him.[AN]
[MidRight]
We will find Mila, but the people of[NL]
Zofia need us now. When I took[AN]
the oaths of a priestess, I swore[NL]
on this sword to protect the innocent.[AN] 
The Mother does not take it upon[NL]
herself to rid the earth of evil men.[AN]
It falls to the people, as her servants,[NL]
to enact justice among themselves.[AN]
I'd be failing my duties to her[NL]
if I were to ignore such a villain.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...There's no arguing with you[NL]
when you get like this. Heh.[AN]
Well, it is what it is, and what it is[NL]
is a bit more time on my contract.[AN]
We'll head out at your command.[AN]
