[MidLeft][LoadCelica][HalfCloseEyes]
*sigh*...[AN]
[Right]
Celica! [.4][MoveRight]Hey, Celica![AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Hmm?[.4] I'm sorry, Mae.[NL]
I was lost in thought.[AN]
Did you need something?[AN]
[Right]
Me?[.4] Naw, I'm fine like always.[NL]
But what about YOU?![AN]
That guy leading the Deliverance is[NL]
a friend of yours, right?[AN]
I know we're in a rush, but surely we[NL]
had time for you to say good-bye![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
It's fine.[.4] That isn't necessary.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
But Celi--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mae, I need to reach the Temple[NL]
of Mila as soon as possible.[AN]
I know the Mother will reveal[NL]
a path to save Zofia[AN]
that doesn't involve violence.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadBoey]
[Right]
I dunno about this, Boey[Beat][NL]
Celica's acting all weird.[AN]
I wonder what happened?[AN]
[FarRight]
Well, can you blame her? I'm sure[NL]
she's more than a little conflicted.[AN]
If the Deliverance defeats Desaix and[NL]
drives the empire back, what next?[AN]
Zofia will need a ruler,[AN]
and who better than a boy who[NL]
cast off tyranny's yoke?[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
What?![.4] But Celica's[NL]
the rightful heir![AN]
[FarRight]
Yeah, but she can't exactly just go[NL]
and announce that to everyone.[AN]
If she did, she'd be made to lead[NL]
the Deliverance effort herself.[AN]
Believe me, that's the last thing[NL]
Celica wants right now.[AN]
[Right]
I hate it when you make sense, Boey.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But that just means we have to[NL]
haul tail to the Temple of Mila![AN]
The Earth Mother will know what to do.[NL]
She'll take care of everything![AN]
[FarRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
I pray it's truly so simple.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Once we cross this mountain,[NL]
we'll finally reach the coast.[AN]
It's a hard climb,[NL]
but I know we'll make it.[AN]

Waugh![.4] Earthquake?![AN]
[FarRight]
Gah![.4] I c-can't even stand![AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarFarRight][FarFarRight][ClearFace]
[Right]
Look out! The cliff is crumbling![AN]
[Left][LoadBoey][MoveLeft]
Oh, you have to be joking![AN]
As if anything else could have gone[NL]
wrong on this blasted adventure![AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Everyone, be careful![NL]
Stay low to the ground![AN]
[X]

## Ch3_Celica_Start_3
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[MidRight][LoadConrad]
Are you unhurt?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wh-[.4]Who are you?[AN]
[MidRight]
My identity is of no consequence.[NL]
All that matters is that you're safe.[AN]
I came to warn you of the fault line[NL]
that crosses this pass--[.4]but alas,[AN]
my steed was no match for the speed[NL]
of a force of nature.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
And am I meant to accept that as[NL]
the entire story here?[AN]
I've been pursued tirelessly by strange[NL]
men in hoods for most of this journey.[AN]
Why,[.4] then,[.4] should I take a masked man[NL]
with no name at his word?[AN]
[MidRight]
...It's true,[.4] I've given you[NL]
no cause to trust me.[AN]
The only assurance I can offer[NL]
is that we face the same enemy.[AN]
This mask is a necessary evil--[AN]
I risk my life speaking to you[NL]
even from behind it.[AN]
I only hope that this is enough[NL]
to bend your ear to my missive.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[Beat] ...I apologize.[NL]
I will hear your message.[AN]
[MidRight]
You must reach the Temple of Mila.[AN]
The road along the Zofian coast should[NL]
give you safe passage into the valley.[AN]
If you remain path-bound, you won't[NL]
be slowed by the desert sands as was I.[AN]
That desert is also the dominion of a[NL]
fearsome thief-king and kidnapper.[AN][NL]
Hear me:[.4] you mustn't cross him.[AN]
You have great courage, but I beg you--[NL]
take no unnecessary risks.[AN]
Your choices steer the fates of[NL]
more than just yourself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Thank you--[.4][AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
...He's gone?[AN]
[Right][LoadBoey]
[FarRight][LoadMae]
Talk about shady characters.[AN]
But at least he's not[NL]
trying to kidnap you?[AN]
[Right]
That's an awfully low bar to clear.[NL]
I don't like the looks of that man.[AN]
I assure you,[.4] milady,[.4] if he puts[NL]
one foot out of line,[.4] I'll--[AN]
[MidLeft]
--It's strange, Boey.[NL]
The only reason I heard him out...[AN]
It was because something about him[NL]
reminds me of you.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
M-[.4]Me?[.4] I fail to see[NL]
the resemblance![AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadSaber]
Looks like Mr. Mask's got[NL]
some good intel, at least.[AN]
You got any guess as to[NL]
who he might be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
None.[AN]
I've no allies left in this world,[NL]
save the ones I travel with now.[AN]
[FarRight]
Oof.[.4] Didn't mean to sour the mood.[NL]
Forget I asked.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Back to the matter at hand...[AN]
The road back to the castle[NL]
is well and truly blocked off.[AN]
I suppose we've no choice but to[NL]
follow that man's directions.[AN]
[Right]
Well, it's a lucky thing we've no[NL]
need to head back there.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Now we couldn't go to aid Alm[NL]
even if we wanted to...[AN]
[Right]
...Milady?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica_Angry]
It's nothing.[.4] We've spent enough[NL]
time here.[.4] Let's press on.[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

Heh heh...[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Left]
That must be Garth and his men.[AN]
Probably best to avoid them.[NL]
Let's go around that way.[AN]
[FarLeft]
But Celica, look![AN]

Huh?[AN]

More of Grieth's thugs, I take it?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadGarth]
Well, give the little girl a prize![NL]
Yer pretty smart for a foreign lass.[AN]
Might be ye also know how much coin[NL]
a pair like you could fetch![AN]

Well, we sure can't leave them[NL]
to this rabble.[.5] Let's go, everyone![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Thank the Mother we managed to[NL]
keep those sisters safe...[AN]
[FarRight][LoadCatria]
[Right][LoadPalla]
Oh, good![.4] I was hoping we'd find you.[NL]
You really saved us today.[AN]
[FarRight]
I'm glad we've found a chance[NL]
to thank you properly.[AN]
We've managed to dig up some additional[NL]
information on our sister's fate.[AN]
[Right]
Turns out our sister Est is being[NL]
held by a thief named Grieth.[AN]
Your strength is beyond reproach,[NL]
that much is certain...[AN]
If you're headed to Grieth's citadel,[NL]
perhaps you'd let us join you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is a bit of a detour,[.4] but...[NL]
I can't abandon someone in such need.[AN]
We'll advance on Grieth's base[NL]
as soon as we depart.[AN]
[FarRight]
Thank you, Celica.[.5] We'll be glad[NL]
to lend you our strength.[AN]

What a terrible fate.[NL]
If only I were stronger...[AN][OpenEyes]
...In any case, we must keep moving.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCatria]
...Excuse me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, Catria...[AN][CloseEyes]
I'm so sorry we weren't able to[NL]
help your sister in time...[AN]
[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Please...[.5] allow me to travel with you.[AN]
I don't think I could bear[NL]
losing both my sisters.[AN]
You must rescue Est.[NL]
Please...[.5] promise me this.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
I swear it, [.4]we will rescue her.[AN]
We'll be advancing on Grieth's base[NL]
as soon as we leave.[AN]

What a terrible fate.[NL]
If only I were stronger...[AN][OpenEyes]
...In any case,[.4] we must keep moving.[AN]
There's tell of a thief-king named[NL]
Grieth's stronghold in the desert...[AN]
Perhaps I can at least save[NL]
their surviving sister.[AN]
