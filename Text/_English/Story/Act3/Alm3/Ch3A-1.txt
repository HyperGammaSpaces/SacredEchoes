Good.[.4] You're all here.[NL]
Let's be on our way.[AN]
[Right]
Uhm[Beat][NL]
Are you sure about this, Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Am I sure about what?[AN]
[Right]
Oh, please.[.4] About Celica![AN]
You finally see her after gods-know[NL]
how long, and you end up in a spat?[AN]
[MoveRight]Hey, don't give me that look--[NL]
she clearly took off in a right huff.[AN]
You two used to be inseparable.[NL]
What happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That was a long time ago, Tobin.[NL]
A lot's happened--[.4]to both of us.[AN]
[Right]
Well, I'm no expert, but I think[NL]
a normal person would just apologize.[AN]
I'm sure she hasn't gotten too far yet,[NL]
what with those skinny legs and all...[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Seriously, Tobin? Y-[.4]you're passing out[NL]
relationship advice now?[AN]
Give it a rest--[AN]
it's not like every fight has a[NL]
right side and a wrong side.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
Get over it, Gray.[NL]
I'm well aware of that![AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
Well, this could be the last time[NL]
Alm and Celica see each other.[AN]
You'd think they'd wanna part on[NL]
a[Beat] less-sour note.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's all right, Tobin.[NL]
I appreciate what you're saying.[AN]
But this is something for me and[NL]
Celica to work out on our own.[AN]
Besides, I'm the leader[NL]
of the Deliverance now.[AN]
It wouldn't be right to keep everyone[NL]
waiting on my own private business.[AN]
[Right]
Alm...[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadSoldier_Blue]
Sir Alm! Our scouts have spied[NL]
Rigelian forces up ahead![AN]
[Right]
[Beat] ...Then the battle[NL]
begins here.[AN]
[FarRight]
So it seems.[AN]
The fights ahead will be nothing like[NL]
our skirmishes in the south.[AN]
You've wounded Rigel's pride, and[NL]
they will strike back without mercy.[AN]
But the spirit of Zofia[NL]
demands you prevail.[AN]
There's no turning back now.[AN]
[Right]
I know.[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_OpeningText_2
[MidRight][LoadAlm]
[FarLeft][LoadFernand]
There you are, whelp.[NL]
I thought you'd never arrive.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wait a second...[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_OpeningText_3
[FarLeft][LoadFernand]
[MidRight][LoadClive]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Fernand?![AN]
You march beneath[NL]
Rigel's standard now?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Does that really surprise you, Clive?[AN]
You and the Deliverance took all I[NL]
believed in and trod it into the mire.[AN]
In Rigel, they still have[NL]
ideals worth upholding.[AN]
[MidRight]
Damn you, Fernand![NL]
Listen to yourself![AN]
[FarLeft]
My king is dead.[NL]
My country fallen.[AN]
But I'll not hand this[NL]
land over to you.[AN]
Now, it is the Rigelian Empire's turn.[AN]
Lord Berkut shall lead us and[NL]
unite Valentia under one noble order![AN]
[MidRight]
Come to your senses, Fernand![AN]
You have always fought for[NL]
your motherland--for Zofia![AN]
[FarLeft]
Only one of us has lost[NL]
his senses, Clive.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Allow me to enlighten you.[AN]
That boy you have been[NL]
parading around as your new hero?[AN]
He was never Mycen's grandson.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
What is this folly?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Oh, I can assure you it is no folly.[AN]
My source has known[NL]
Sir Mycen for years.[AN]
The old knight has no family.[AN]
Perhaps he made some orphan his ward[NL]
so he wouldn't have to die alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
You lie...[AN]
And yet there is the matter of what[NL]
the old man at the castle said...[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha ha! Oh, Clive.[.5] You've become[NL]
the very picture of absurdity.[AN]
Once you were a man to whom the[NL]
lineage of our noble houses meant all.[AN]
But now you take for your future king[NL]
a boy you don't know from a gutter rat![AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

## Ch3_1A_FernandBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadFernand]
Come at me.[NL]
Surely you detestable vermin[AN]
don't think you can stand[NL]
against a true nobleman?[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_FernandBattleQuote_Clive
[MidRight][LoadClive]
Fernand...[.5] You wouldn't truly[NL]
turn your lance against me,[AN]
would you?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadFernand]
Why not?![AN]
You've already driven yours[NL]
through my heart[AN]
with your betrayal.[AN]
I am only defending my honor![AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_FernandDefeatQuote
[MidLeft][LoadFernand]
Nnngh...[NL][CloseEyes]
I have...[.5] no choice...[AN]
I must fall back...[AN]
and rejoin Lord Berkut[NL]
in the main force...[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_ZaxonBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadZaxon]
You don't look half[NL]
as scared as you ought.[AN]
Don't you value your lives?[AN]
It's time you had the fear[NL]
of death put back into you![AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_ZaxonDeathQuote
[MidLeft][LoadZaxon]
No...[AN][CloseEyes]
I'll not surrender...[NL]
Not like...[.5] this...[AN]

[MidLeft]
The Rigelian Knights are here?![AN]
Blast...[.5] if only I wasn't[NL]
too old to fight them myself.[AN]
Take this lance.[.5] It will help you[NL]
pierce heavy armor.[AN]
But be aware--[NL]
it's awfully heavy itself.[AN]
Be wary about what battles[NL]
you carry it into.[AN]
[X]

## Ch3_1A_EndingText
[MidRight][LoadClive][HalfCloseEyes]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
We've emerged victorious, but...[AN]
the survivors will be making their[NL]
way back to the main force.[AN]
We can't rest on our laurels now.[NL]
Wouldn't you agree, Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
...Hmm?[NL][OpenEyes]
Oh, yes.[.5] Quite.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is it? You look shaken.[AN]
[Beat]Oh, right.[.5] Forgive me.[NL]
You and Fernand were good friends.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, it's not that...[NL][CloseEyes]
Well, it's not JUST that...[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
In any case, it's nothing you need[NL]
trouble yourself with.[AN]
If you'll excuse me.[AN][MidRight][ClearFace]
[....]
[MidLeft]
What's with him?[AN]
