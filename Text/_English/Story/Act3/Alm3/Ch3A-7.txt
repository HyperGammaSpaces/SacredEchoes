So this is the Zofian Sluice Gate...[NL]
It's massive![AN]
[FarRight]
Indeed it is.[AN]
And were it to collapse, the damage[NL]
would be more massive still.[AN]
[Right]
With the gate under enemy control,[NL]
we're in a vulnerable position...[AN]
They could manipulate the water pressure[NL]
to cause such a collapse intentionally.[AN]
Not only would Zofia's lowlands flood,[NL]
but Rigel's crops rely on the sluice[AN]
for most of their irrigation.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're saying the Rigelians would[NL]
let their countrymen starve[AN]
just to get the upper hand?[NL][MoveMidLeft]
Come on,[.4] that can't be true.[AN]
They might burn our granaries down,[NL]
but they wouldn't destroy their own.[AN]
Nobody's actually that cruel.[.4] Right?[AN]
[Right]
Alm[Beat] Please don't be[NL]
so naive about this.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
Tatarrah is an arcanist of the[NL]
Duma Faithful--[.4]beholden to none[AN]
but a god who glorifies victory[NL]
in battle above all else.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
We cannot assume a votary like him[NL]
would not choose that very doctrine[AN]
over the code of ethics that binds[NL]
Rigel's legitimate soldiers.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right...[.4] Then we need to act fast.[AN]
We have to take Tatarrah out before[NL]
he floods both sides of this border![AN]
