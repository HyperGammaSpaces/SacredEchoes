Unlike you, I have been too willing[NL]

I stand by my belief that a commander[NL]

But failing to rescue Mathilda or[NL]
my sister was cowardice, not reason.[AN]

Stop it, Clive.[NL]
You're no craven.[AN]

Aren't I? Just look at[NL]
what you did in my stead.[AN]
I criticized you roundly for diverting[NL]
