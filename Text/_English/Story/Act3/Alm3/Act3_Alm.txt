[MidLeft]
Hey,[.4] Luthier.[NL]
How are you holding up?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm?[.5][MoveMidRight] Ah,[.4] um,[.4] well,[.4] I am in[NL]
fine enough spirits,[.4] Sir Alm.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh,[.4] uh,[.4] you can just call me Alm.[NL]
No need for the [0x93]Sir[0x94] stuff.[AN]
[MidRight]
My apologies.[.4] I am never quite sure[NL]
how to conduct myself in conversation,[AN]
so I would much rather err on[NL]
the side of formality.[AN]
...If I might ask,[.4] what has prompted[NL]
you to speak with me in particular?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I noticed you're usually sitting[NL]
off by yourself at mealtimes,[AN]
and I know you must be really[NL]
worried about your sister.[AN]
So I just wanted to know if there's[NL]
anything I can do to ease your spirits[AN]
while we're on the way to her.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
O-[.4]Oh[Beat] That's very kind of you, Alm.[AN][2NL]
But I assure you,[.4] I spend my time[NL]
alone of my own volition.[AN]
I find the company of others to be[NL]
a struggle in itself.[AN]
The company of cats,[.4] however...[NL][ToggleSmile]
That is a different matter entirely.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh,[.4] now that you mention it,[NL]
it wouldn't be a bad idea to have[AN]
a cat around to guard the rations.[AN]
We could name it something cool,[NL]
and it'd be part of the army.[AN]
I kind of want to call it Sir Purr.[NL][MoveMidLeft]
We could knight it and everything![AN]
[MidRight]
Ohh...[.4][MoveMidRight] Now that would be[NL]
simply delightful![AN]
In fact,[.4] I haven't the words[NL]
to thank you properly...[AN]
I would be honored to take on[NL]
even the most unpleasant duties[AN]
of cat stewardship in order to[NL]
make this dream a reality.[AN][MoveMidRight]
Leave the litterbox to me,[NL]
my most esteemed commander![AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Hah[Beat] What a funny guy.[NL]
I'm glad he's starting to loosen up.[AN]
