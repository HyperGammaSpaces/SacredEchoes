This sword...[NL]
What could it mean?[AN]
The mark on my hand tingles[NL]
when I'm holding it.[AN]
I guess the mark's kind of shaped[NL]
like a sword,[.4] anyway.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]
Heh...[.4] yeah,[.4] that must be it.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
Alm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh?[.4] Oh--[.4]Lukas![NL]
You didn't hear that,[.4] did you?[AN]
What do you need?[.4] Orders?[.4] Supplies?[AN]
[MidRight]
No need to worry.[.4] I was just going to[NL]
suggest we make camp here tonight.[AN]
There's a fort just ahead that yet[NL]
flies Zofia's standards,[AN]
and it's a long way still[NL]
to the sluice.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]This is an awfully nice fort.[AN]
I mean,[.4] nothing compared to Desaix's,[NL]
but it's strange that it's so[Beat] empty.[AN]
There's even half-eaten bread[NL]
still on the tables[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
It seems word of Desaix's defeat[NL]
has reached his remaining loyalists.[AN]
Those who haven't already joined ranks[NL]
with Rigel or the Deliverance[AN]
have likely returned to their homes.[NL][ToggleSmile]
And not a moment too late,[.4] clearly.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I guess if I'd been stationed[NL]
under Desaix this whole time,[AN]
I wouldn't have waited to[NL]
finish my bread either.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway,[.4] that's good,[.4] right?[NL]
Fewer troops to stand in our way?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
While that's partially true,[NL]
now all who remain in the war effort[AN]
are those whose hearts are sworn to[NL]
battle.[.4] Those who no longer have doubt.[AN]
Within our ranks and the enemy's alike,[NL]
only the most determined remain.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you're saying we should be worried?[AN]
[MidRight]
Worried,[.4] no.[.5] Strategic and alert,[.4] yes.[AN]
[Beat]
Truth be told[Beat] the thought of doing[NL]
battle against forces just as fierce[AN]
and passionate as our own...[NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Well,[.4] it excites me,[.4] in a way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hah![.4] I didn't expect to hear that[NL]
from you,[.4] of all people.[AN]
But I feel the same way.[.4] I'm not[NL]
scared at all,[.4] strangely enough.[AN]
It's almost like I'm[NL]
looking forward to it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't get carried away,[.4] now.[AN]
Take advantage of the accomodations and[NL]
get some rest for tomorrow's march.[AN]
I'll handle the night watch.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right.[.4] Good night,[.4] Lukas.[NL]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
And...[.4] thanks. [.4][CloseEyes]For being around.[AN]

Heh heh heh...[AN]
Flying the Zofian colors,[.4] huh?[NL]
It can only be the Deliverance.[AN]
With that bucket of hog fat Desaix[NL]
out of the way,[.4] there's no need[AN]
to try and tell his men apart[NL]
from the rest of these slugabeds.[AN][MoveMidRight]
Listen up, troops![.4] Gather slowly,[.4] and[NL]
surround the fort before they wake![AN]
The damned layabouts won't know[NL]
what hit them.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadLawson][ToggleSmile]
Hear that, men?[NL]
Footsteps,[.4] just beyond the door.[AN]
That's our cue.[.4] Overwhelm them with[NL]
the might of Rigel's cavalry![AN]

confronted me about this.[AN]

But he helped you and Mathilda[NL]
found the Deliverance,[.4] didn't he?[AN]
So he deserves my respect,[.4] no matter[NL]

If he returns to the Deliverance,[NL]
