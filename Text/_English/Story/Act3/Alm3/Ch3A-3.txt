A moment please, Alm.[.5] I have[NL]
a fresh report from our scouts.[AN]
Apparently,[.4] the enemy's main force has[NL]
retreated west through the forest.[AN]
But before we give chase,[NL]
we should deal with Desaix.[AN]
It wouldn't be wise to pass him by[NL]
while his fortress lies in reach.[AN]
[MidLeft]
All right, that makes sense.[NL]
But listen,[.4] Lukas...[AN]
Do you know anything about the[NL]
Rigelian general Fernand mentioned?[AN]
Berkut,[.4] I believe it was?[AN]
[Right]
Lord Berkut, yes.[.5] I am no stranger[NL]
to the rumors, at least.[AN]
They say he is about your age.[AN]
A talented young general[NL]
of royal blood...[AN]
It's no wonder Fernand is[NL]
so smitten with him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat][AN]
Does it really matter so much[NL]
where you're born,[AN]
or who your father was?[AN]
[Right]
I beg your pardon?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh--[.4]sorry,[.4] I was just...[AN]
I don't mean to speak ill[NL]
of nobles or anything.[AN]
[Right]
Well,[.4] I should hope not.[AN]
Your own grandfather was[NL]
a count,[.4] after all.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadClive]
[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I know,[.4] but...[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight]
[Beat] Enough of this talk.[AN]
Alm,[.4] beyond this forest[NL]
lies a great army--[AN]
you shouldn't trouble yourself with[NL]
anything but the battles ahead.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're right, Clive.[NL]
I apologize.[AN]

The Deliverance![AN]
Well,[.4] this is simply delightful.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Huh?![.4] Fernand![NL]
And who's this?[AN]
[Left]
My name is Berkut.[AN]
I am nephew to His Majesty,[NL]
Emperor Rudolf.[AN]
[MidRight]
So here he is...[AN]
[Left]
Alm,[.4] was it?[AN]
I must say,[.4] I was most impressed by[NL]
the battle at Zofia Castle.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I nearly mistook that motley band of[NL]
rustics you were leading for an army.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][LoadClive]
What are you doing here?[NL]
Your main force has retreated.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Berkut longs for sport[NL]
and wishes to test your might.[AN]
[Left]
I've gone too long without fighting,[NL]
and felt I needed a spot of practice.[AN]
Now then...[.5] do try to make this[NL]
little exercise worth my time![AN]

That mark on your left hand...[NL]
Where did that come from?[AN]
[MidRight]
What do you care?![NL]
Are you here to fight or not?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
No...[.5] It cannot be the Brand.[NL]
Not on one as unremarkable as you.[AN]
It must be false.[NL]
Just like its bearer![AN]

They're stronger[NL]

I needn't test you[NL]

[MidLeft][LoadXyzas]
Hmph.[.5] It doesn't take a[NL]
village idiot to see[AN]
that you're outmatched.[AN]
If you're eager to die,[NL]
I'd be happy to oblige.[AN]
Have at me![AN]

I'm not quite sure how[NL]
we just pulled that off...[AN]
There were only three of them--[NL]
how did they give us so much trouble?[AN]
[MidRight]
Rigel may be stronger than[NL]
I first believed...[AN]
What if this IS a mistake?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Did you say something, Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
...It was nothing.[AN]
Come,[.4] we must plan our siege[NL]
of Desaix's fortress.[AN]
Mathilda's fate only grows more dire[NL]
the longer we delay.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Right.[.5] Listen,[.4] Clive,[.4] I'm sorry[NL]
about what I said the other day.[AN]
I know she's important to you.[NL]
I'll do everything I can to help.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thank you, Alm.[AN]
I...[.5] think it's important you know[NL]
that she and I made a promise.[AN]
It's true she's an exceptional[NL]
commander and officer,[.4] but...[AN]
she is also my fianc[0xE9]e.[AN]
The Deliverance could very well[NL]
carry on without her,[AN]
but I am not a strong enough man[NL]
to say the same of myself.[AN]
I am far more selfish and cowardly[NL]
than you think me to be, Alm.[AN]
So please...[.5] forgive me,[NL]
and indulge this one request.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Understood.[NL]
I won't let you down.[AN]
