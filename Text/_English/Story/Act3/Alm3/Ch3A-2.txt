Alright, sir.[NL]
We've got the girl.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Master Tatarrah awaits your arrival[NL]
at the Sluice Gate.[AN]
Deliver the young mage to him,[NL]
and the Rigelian Army will be sure[AN]
to give you a prestigious title[NL]
for your service and loyalty.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Excellent...[.5] In the meantime,[NL]
I trust that you will be able to[AN]
torch this pitiful little hovel and its[NL]
surroundings without my assistance?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Do not underestimate us.[AN]
The Duma Faithful serve[NL]
the War Father directly[AN]
and are imbued with his power.[AN]
It would do you some good[NL]
to trust in our abilities.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, of course![.4] I must admit,[AN]
I am eager to see the true power[NL]
of the War Father.[AN]
(Seeing as it was clearly too great[NL]
to waste on a single maiden[AN]
and a couple of mercenaries.)[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Run along now,[.4] rat.[AN]
Me and my men will make[NL]
quick work of this village,[AN]
and ensure that the mage champion's[NL]
bloodline can cause us no trouble.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I wish you luck in your task.[NL]
May the blessings of Duma be upon you.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft]
Hmph.[AN][ClearFace]
[.....]
[MidRight]
You![.4] Girl![.4] You will come with me.[AN]
You'll make a fine sacrifice to whatever[NL]
false god these fools are on about.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadClive]
Alm,[.4] please.[.5] We can't spend time[NL]
chasing this [0x93]hunch[0x94] of yours further.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I swear,[.4] it sounded like someone[NL]
shouting for help.[AN]
I can't just let that go unheard.[AN]
[MidRight]
The weather and terrain offer such[NL]
poor visibility,[.4] though...[AN]
We have no way of knowing which[NL]
direction the assailant ran.[AN]
I hate to say it,[.4] but in these[NL]
conditions,[.4] the wisest choice[AN]
would be to give up and focus on[NL]
the march forward.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We can't ignore someone in need![NL]
I'm going in to investigate.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm,[.4] please--[.4] the risk is too great.[AN]
How much more time will we lose[NL]
searching in this darkness?[AN]
We should either forge ahead,[NL]
or rest for the night[AN]
and search again come morning.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Listen,[.4] Clive--[.4] I'm not doing this[NL]
as the leader of the Deliverance.[AN]
I'm doing this because it's[NL]
the right thing to do,[AN]
regardless of who comes along[NL]
to back me up.[AN]
If you think it's best to leave[NL]
me behind and keep advancing,[AN]
you're free to do so.[NL]
But I'm saving that girl![AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat] ...I may have made a[NL]
terrible miscalculation.[AN]

Those fiends...![AN]
If only I had the cat-eyes to see[NL]
in this accursed darkness...[AN]
I must pursue her captors regardless![AN]

This water helps resist magic.[NL]
It is an ancient secret of our village.[AN]
Please,[.4] ensure Delthea returns safely...[AN]
The legacy of our village's founder[NL]
lives on in her alone...[AN]

*gasp*[.4] You there![AN]
You're with the Deliverance,[NL]
are you not?[AN]
[MidRight]
I am.[.5] Who are you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
My name is Luthier.[AN]
Merely a humble mage[NL]
from a humble village.[AN]
On this day,[.4] however,[.4] I cry your aid,[NL]
for my younger sister is in trouble![AN]
[MidRight]
What happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
First of all,[.4] you should know that[NL]
my sister is named Delthea.[AN]
She possesses magical potential beyond[NL]
that of any in our village.[AN]
One of Rigel's arcanists,[NL]
Tatarrah,[.4] caught wind of this[AN]
and had her kidnapped.[AN]
He's going to use his powers to[NL]
control her and make her guard[AN]
the northern sluice.[AN]
They plan to block the sluice until[NL]
it collapses and Zofia is flooded.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?![NL]
But that would be catastrophic![AN]
[MidLeft]
Indeed it would.[.5] Surely you're[NL]
planning to stop them,[.4] correct?[AN]
If so,[.4] I ask that you[NL]
also rescue my sister.[AN]
I'll even go with you if you like.[AN]
If we defeat Tatarrah,[.4] that will[NL]
release his hold on her.[AN]

Are you with the Deliverance?[NL]
I'm afraid I have some ill news.[AN]
One of the enemy soldiers mentioned[NL]
a lady knight they're holding captive.[AN]
Desaix plans to put her to death soon[NL]
as an example to others...[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
What?![NL]
They intend to execute Mathilda?![AN]
[MidRight]
I fear so,[.4] good sir knight.[AN]
If she's dear to you,[.4] you'd best march[NL]
on his fortress before it's too late.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadClive]
Alm--[.5] do you see now[NL]
why we must make haste?![AN]
We were at a stalemate for so long,[NL]
but now Desaix knows[AN]
our forces are on the move.[AN]
If he puts Mathilda to the gibbet,[NL]
I...[.5] I don't know what I'll do.[AN]
We haven't time to waste.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hold on a moment...[.5] You were the one[NL]
saying we should give up on rescuing[AN]
the girl from this village.[AN]
Now we're to drop everything to rescue[NL]
Mathilda because she's special to you?[AN]
I understand how you feel--[NL]
I'll drop everything to save her--[AN]
but don't you think the village girl's[NL]
brother feels the same way about her?[AN]
[Right]
Well--[.5] I--[.5] That's different,[NL]
Mathilda's an officer,[.4] and...[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What the hell does that[NL]
have to do with it?![AN]
[Right]
Alm, what's gotten into you?![NL]
It's not even comparable![AN]
It's Mathilda who is the finest knight[NL]
in all the land,[.4] not me.[AN]
She's irreplaceable.[.5] The Deliverance[NL]
needs her.[.5] I need her.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]...[AN]
[.5][Right]
[Beat]...I'm...[.4] sorry.[NL]
Please,[.4] get some rest, Alm.[AN]
We march at dawn.[AN]
