[MidRight]
Wh-what are you talking about?![AN]
S-Surely we would not have[NL]
suffered a defeat so crushing--[AN]
What of Clive?![AN]
[MidLeft]
He has cast off both the command of[NL]
the Deliverance and its very soul,[AN]
and trampled them into the muck to be[NL]
gobbled up by a lowborn peasant.[AN]
I have sworn my lance instead to[NL]
Lord Berkut of the Rigelian Empire.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
The general who leads our enemies?![.5][NL]
Has madness taken you?![AN]
A lance sworn to him is[NL]
a lance through my heart.[AN]
Don't you care about Zofia?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Zofia?[.5] You mean the proud kingdom[NL]
whose riches fell to ignorant savages?[AN]
Zofia is dead to me.[.5] I have buried her[NL]
and will not look back.[AN]
[MidRight]
How can you say such a thing, Fernand?[NL]
You and Clive were like brothers.[AN]
It's not too late to fix this.[NL]
Return to the Deliverance![AN]
I know Clive would welcome you back[NL]
with open arms.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The Clive I knew and revered is[NL]
not the same man betrothed to you.[AN]
The old Clive was a born leader,[AN]
a paragon of chivalry and virtue[NL]
who inspired all who looked to him.[AN]
Now he is rendered so impotent[NL]
at the thought of losing you[AN]
that he has abandoned the very[NL]
principles that made him a knight![AN][MoveMidLeft]
You have made my dearest friend[NL]
a cuckold to your own ineptitude![AN]
I regret ever letting him[NL]
bring you into our ranks.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
LETTING him--?![AN]
Have you forgotten[NL]
to whom you speak?![AN]
...I've heard enough.[AN]
You, too,[.4] have changed[NL]
more than you think.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tch.[.4] What's done is done.[AN]
Desaix intends to have you put[NL]
to death.[.4] It won't be long now.[AN]
[MidRight][.5][CloseEyes][.5]
...What would Clive think[NL]
if he could hear you now?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Oh,[.4] he's made it QUITE clear[NL]
where his sympathies lie.[AN]
Farewell, Mathilda.[AN][ClearFace]

It seems she is of[NL]

Forgive me,[.4] Mathilda.[AN]
I should never have left you[NL]

Speak now your loathing for me,[NL]

[Right]
Oh,[.4] stop your nonsense.[.5][NL]
You did what any commander ought.[AN]
Your judgment was sound.[AN]
And I bear the blame for my capture,[NL]
not you.[.5] I was careless.[AN]
So let us speak no more of blame.[AN]

I AM thrilled,[.4] but...[AN]
Desaix's dying words[NL]
have been troubling me.[AN]
Something about my grandfather[NL]

[MidLeft]
Huh? You sure you're not[NL]
imagining things?[AN]
What would Sir Mycen and the Rigelian[NL]
emperor have to do with each other?[AN]
[MidRight]
That's what concerns me.[AN]
Something's been bothering me lately.[NL]
Something I can't shake.[AN]
It feels like every victory I secure[NL]
takes me one step further from Zofia.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha![.4] Am I allowed to point out that[NL]
that's literally what's happening?[AN]
We're a long way from[NL]
Ram Village,[.4] kid.[AN]
Look,[.4] I'm worried too.[.5] About my family,[NL]
about everyone else we left behind...[AN]
I miss them all terribly,[NL]

But that's okay,[.4] Alm.[AN]

Desaix stole from Zofia Castle?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well...[.5] it certainly looks important.[NL]
Should we open it?[AN]

It won't...[.5] budge...[AN]

This must be the[NL]
Royal Sword of Zofia.[AN]
[MidRight]
What's that?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Long ago,[.4] Rigel presented this sword[NL]
to Zofia as a symbol of friendship.[AN]
It's a very special treasure--[NL]
only one of royal blood can lift it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm...[.4] Interesting.[.5] Here,[.4] Tobin--[NL]
