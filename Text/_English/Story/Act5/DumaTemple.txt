## RineaSacrifice_Scene
[Berkut]
It's not possible... Alm is the emperor's true son? Which makes him the rightful successor to the imperial throne. All this time... All the effort! What has it all been for?! ...No. It isn't true. It can't be. I refuse to believe it. Nothing but lies. Lies, lies, lies, lies, LIES!
[Berkut]
Is that... an altar? How did I get here? What's happening?
[Duma]
Heed me...
[Berkut]
Who are y--
[Duma]
Heed me, you who thirst for power... Call to me. Accept me unto your soul.
[Berkut]
That voice... Duma? Is it really you?
[Duma]
...
[Berkut]
What...?
[Rinea]
Lord Berkut!
[Berkut]
Rinea...
[Rinea]
I've been looking all over for you. (something about berkut's recent religious delusions)
[Berkut]
This is true... But then I had the throne snatched from under me by some magical heir. Plying the gods' mercies is what men do in hopeless situations, is it not?
[Rinea]
I didn't mean... Forgive me. I shouldn't have said anything.
[Berkut]
...
[Rinea]
Please don't despair so. Alm seems a kind and generous man. I'm certain he'll treat you fair.
[Berkut]
And I'm to be content with that?!
[Rinea]
Ah!
[Berkut]
I wanted to BEAT him, Rinea! To dispatch him and claim the throne! I wanted to make you my empress and hold all Valentia in our palms together! But what of those dreams now...? Even Rigel alone is now forever beyond my grasp. So I'm to live in this Alm's shadow? Throw myself upon his mercy? I would sooner an honorable death at the executioner's blade!
[Rinea]
Berkut! You mustn't say such things. I never... The truth is, I never wanted to be empress.
[Berkut]
What?
[Rinea]
I think it might be nice to live a quiet life in a little villa somewhere. The crown is a terribly heavy thing... It's even... relieving, not to have to worry about it anymore. I think it was beginning to take a toll on y-- Berkut?
[Berkut]
...You too, Rinea?
[Rinea]
What?
[Berkut]
Were you laughing along with them? Rudolf, Massena, and all the rest? Watching me toil away while you knew I would never become emperor! Was every kind word part of the act? Every smile an act of PITY?!
[Rinea]
Berkut, you're frightening me!
[Berkut]
Duma! O ancient god! I call out to you now! Grant me the power to set this land to ruin for good and all! Take of me what price you will! I care not anymore!
[Rinea]
Eeek!

[Fernand]
Lord Berkut! Lord Berkut...?
[Berkut]
Is this what you desire, Lord Duma?! The blood of my betrothed?! Then I shall boil it in your name!!
[Rinea]
Berkut! Please!! It-- it burns!! Aieeeeh!
[Fernand]
Lady Rinea--!! Berkut, by all that is holy-- RELEASE HER!
[Berkut]
Power... is... all that is holy... anymore.
[Rinea]
Aieeeeeeeh!!
Ahurhgh... ggn...
.......
[Fernand]
Y-You... You heartless BEAST! I'll stop your madness here and now--

[Fernand]
Guaagh--! M-my legs-- I can't feel--
[Berkut]
Ah... so much... power. Yes... this is enough. Heh... Heh heh ha ha ha!!

[Alm]
Hold up, everyone.
[Clive]
What is it, Alm?
[Alm]
Someone's... crawling? It's... Fernand?!
[Clive]
What?
[Fernand]
That voice... Clive?
[Clive]
Fernand!

## FernandFinal_Scene_2
[Clive]
Gods, what's happened to you? Don't move-- catch your breath. How long did you have to--
[Fernand]
Spare me your pity. I've none to blame for this but myself... Such trivialities matter not at this point. But you... You made it here. Then you truly intend to slay Duma?
[Clive]
We do, for it was Emperor Rudolf's dying request.
[Fernand]
I see... Then he must have known of Duma's madness.
[Clive]
Duma is mad?
[Fernand]
Oh yes... Duma is a god no longer. Merely an incarnation of the lust for power... ...You there. Alm.
[Alm]
Yeah, that's me.
[Fernand]
Listen well... You must beware of Berkut. He... He's no longer... ...Hngh!
[Alm]
Fernand!
[Fernand]
Please, Alm... Stop Duma. I know I've no right to...ask anything of you... But I beg it of you regardless... You're the only one who can end this. Let no one else be tainted by his madness. Let this tragedy end.
[Alm]
I will. I swear I will lay Duma to rest.
[Fernand]
Then I leave it...to you... Ngh!
[Clive]
Fernand! Don't move. Deep breaths. I'm with you.
[Fernand]
Haah...ha ha... Strange, isn't it...? Me, begging boons of you...
[Clive]
Not in the least. We swore an oath--no matter what comes, you are as my own brother. I'd ride to your aid from the ends of the earth.
[Fernand]
You always were... too nice for your own good. Always so quick to pardon me... Along the way, I forgot how to ask you for forgiveness...
[Clive]
Fernand, please--
[Fernand]
I knew. I always knew. None of my misfortunes were anyone else's fault... Not Alm's, not Mathilda's, certainly not yours. It's mine... and no one else's. I took anger better aimed at myself and turned it on the defenseless masses. And I took you not doing the same on my behalf as a betrayal. I'm... sorry, Clive. I've failed my duty as a nobleman...
[Clive]
It's a relief to hear you admit that, my dear friend. I forgive you...
[Fernand]
But more than that, I... I failed you, Clive. With the rusty spur of my own selfish misery... I hurt the person I loved the most. I knew no way to dress the ulcer of my bereavement, except to graft you over what had not yet festered of my heart. I pushed you to twist yourself into thread just to suture the tatters of my soul back together. All the love and tenderness I felt for you curdled into naught but a covetous obsession. I lashed out in fevered spite at any who dared siphon your attentions from me... I... I don't deserve to say I loved you.
[Clive]
...Enough, Fernand. You've suffered enough. You needn't flog yourself any further.
[Fernand]
Good... I am... tired, dear Clive. Tired of despair... Tired of rage... But I'm... so glad I got to see you one last time. I've always felt such pride... that a man of your caliber called me his friend... even when I wished you had called me something more.
[Clive]
I... I'm here, Fernand. Stay with me. Please.
[Fernand]
It doesn't... hurt anymore. I'll be... with them soon... Heh... Such a send-off in the arms of my beloved is... far more than my treachery deserved. Thank you... Clive. ......
[Clive]
...Fernand? Fernand, no. Don't do this to me. Open your eyes, Fernand! ...Fernand!

I... I loved you both, Fernand. I can't lose you too. Stay with me. Please.
[Fernand]
Ah... I've dreamt of those words... for a very long time. Hold me for just a little longer, my dearest... I'll be... with my family soon... Thank you... Clive. ......

[Clair]
No... Oh, Fernand...

Are you two going to be all right?

...Yes. Grief will have its day, but it will not be this one. Right now, let us do what we must. Lead the way, Alm.
