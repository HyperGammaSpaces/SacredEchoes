I love you so dearly.[.4] And,[.4] I...[AN]
I loved Fernand, too.[.4] In a different way,[NL]
perhaps...[.4] but no more and no less.[AN]
But I had a choice to make,[.4] and I chose[NL]
you--[.4]and I would do so every time.[AN]
So let us not torment ourselves with[NL]
questions of what could have been.[AN]
[MidRight]
This gladdens me, dear Clive.[NL]
Thank you.[AN]
It soothes my soul to see your[NL]
heart laid so plain before me.[AN]
He was a true friend,[.4] and I shall be[NL]
ever by your side as you mourn him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I cannot thank you enough.[NL]
And the first step on that path,[AN]
I think,[.4] would be to settle his score[NL]
with that Lord Berkut.[AN]
Shall we,[.4] my war-goddess?[AN]
[MidRight]
With pleasure.[.4] [MoveMidRight]For the Deliverance![AN]

[MidRight][LoadClair_Sad]
[ToggleMouthMove]Sniff...[.4][ToggleMouthMove] Oh, Brother,[NL]
how could this have happened?[AN]
Fernand was far too young...[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I know, Clair,[.4] I know.[.4][OpenEyes] It feels like[NL]
a part of me has been riven in twain,[AN]
and the other half perished with him.[AN]
[MidRight]
You must be hurting worse than anyone,[NL]
dear brother...[.4] Yet,[.4] I also feel[AN]
as if one of my own kin has passed.[AN]
He was nearly as much of a brother[NL]
to me as you are...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Though we had our disagreements,[AN]
he was family.[.4] I am relieved[NL]
to hear you knew this too.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed, I gibed at him in the[NL]
silly way a sister does and[AN]
fleered at his flaring temper,[AN]
but I wish I could annul[NL]
some of the things I said.[AN]
I so carelessly made sport[NL]
of his reluctance to court,[AN]
and how dear he held you...[AN][CloseEyes]
I never stopped to think on[NL]
how cruel it came across...[AN]
[MidLeft]
I know he never thought you[NL]
to be cruel.[.4] He thought of you[AN]
as a sister as well.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
...Truly?[.4] I was sure he thought of me[NL]
as a right terror,[.4] if anything...[AN]
or at the very least,[.4] disapproved of me.[AN]
He always said I should put down[NL]
the lance and pick up the spindle...[AN][ToggleSmile]
Ha...[.4] [ToggleMouthMove]Sniff...[.4][ToggleMouthMove] It only made me wish[NL]
to join the army even more.[AN]
[MidLeft]
He was always a bit...[.4] uptight,[NL]
let's say,[.4] about such matters.[AN]
In his own way,[.4] he worried a lot about[NL]
your safety and your standing in society.[AN][CloseEyes]
...Even if he could only phrase it[NL]
in the worst way possible.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha...[.4] That's our Fernand, after all.[AN]
Let us dispense with this vile Berkut[NL]
so he may rest in peace.[AN]
As his surviving family,[NL]
that duty falls to us.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Well said, Clair.[.4] Lead the charge![AN]

Why, Berkut?[.4] To have finally found[NL]
my family after all this time...[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Why did it come to this?![AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight]
Heh...[.4][CloseEyes] I have no family...[NL]
nor do I want for one.[AN][OpenEyes]
Now stop talking and finish this.[AN]
End me, and you can stand alone[NL]
as inheritor of Rigel's royal blood.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I never wanted that![.4] Don't you get it?[NL]
I've spent enough of my life alone![AN]
[MidRight]
...The fate of a great man...[.4] is to[NL]
have no one he might call a friend.[AN]
Power is...[.4] the loneliest of burdens,[.4][NL]
and I...[.4] grow weary of carrying it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll carry it WITH you![.4] It doesn't[NL]
have to be this way, Berkut![AN]
We can put this all behind us[NL]
and move on, together.[AN]
You have to live.[.4][MoveMidLeft] You HAVE to--![AN]
[MidRight]
The moment I turned to a power beyond[NL]
myself...[.4] I murdered the man I once was.[AN]
I forswore a life lived by my own honor.[NL]
My blood...[.4] is on my hands alone.[AN][2NL]
[CloseEyes]...Rinea? Is that[Beat] really you?[NL]
[HalfCloseEyes][Beat]Forgive me[.4] for my sins.[AN]
If you'd have me,[.4] I'd[.4] be honored...[.4] to...[AN]
[MidLeft]
Berkut![AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
...Is that you, Alm?[.4] Stop your crying.[NL]
Take this...[.4] Let it be of some use.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A ring... with an inscription?[NL]
[0x93]Svitlana[0x94]...?[AN]
[MidRight]
It was...[.4] my mother's.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
Let her name...[.4][CloseEyes] not be forgotten...[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

Ghrgh--!![AN]

Berkut, no![.4] Please!![.4][NL]
I don't want to be alone again![AN]
Help me rebuild Rigel![.4][NL]
Tell me about my father![AN]
[MidRight]
Alm...[.4] You're not[Beat] a child anymore.[AN][2NL]
You must make Valentia a land[Beat][NL]
not of gods...[.4] but of men.[AN]
A world where people...[.4] never again...[.4][NL]
are corrupted by divine power...[AN]
You can[.4] do it[Beat] without me.[.4][NL][HalfCloseEyes]
I know[.4].[.4].[.4].[.4][CloseEyes] you[.4].[.4].[.4].[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveMidRight]
Berkut![.4] Berkut[Beat][MoveMidRight] Why?[.4][NL]
Someone please tell me...[AN][.4][HalfCloseEyes]
I never got to know you...[.4][NL][CloseEyes]
or my father...[.5] [MoveMidRight][Beat][AN]
