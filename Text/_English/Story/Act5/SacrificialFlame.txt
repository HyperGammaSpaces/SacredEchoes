Alm: There... It's him!

Berkut: Heh... Heh heh ha ha ha... You kept me waiting, Alm! Or should I say...Your Excellency? Perhaps Emperor Rudolf II of Rigel?

Alm: Berkut, listen to--

Berkut: Tell me, how does it feel to possess both Zofia and Rigel? I imagine it's wonderful, though it's a sensation I'll never know.

Alm: This isn't a conquest for me. I have no illusions the people of Rigel will suddenly welcome me as their ruler. But my father placed this land in my care, and I'll do anything for it. Whatever it takes to keep Valentia's people safe.

Berkut: ......

Alm: The path ahead is a difficult one for us all. So help us, Berkut. Lend us your strength! Rigel's people trust and love you far more than me. You and I are cousins, after all. Family. I didn't think I had any family in this world, and yet, here you are. I know we can be close friends as well. Let's work together, Berkut. Put all we have toward ensuring all Valentia is--

Berkut: Silence.

Alm: Um...what?

Berkut: Listen to you, offering mercy and trite platitudes from on high. Work together? Us? Don't make me laugh. Strength isn't lent, it's taken! Pried from the grip of your dead foes!

Berkut: ......

Alm: What the...

Clive: So this is what Fernand warned us about. Alm, Berkut has taken in Duma's power. He's no longer the man we knew!

Alm: No!

Berkut: Ah, my beloved Rinea... Beautiful, isn't she?

Alm: Oh gods... You offered the woman you love up to Duma?!

Berkut: ......

Alm: How could you?! What's the point of power if you have nothing left to protect?!

Berkut: Power won't betray me. Power won't deceive me. Blood ties? Years of life lived together? All meaningless. The only thing in the world a man can rely on is his own strength!

Alm: Years of... Are you accusing my father of betraying you? You're wrong! He loved you! He worried about you to the last! You knew him so much better than I did. How can you not see that?

Berkut: SILENCE! I'm tired of listening to your pretty little lies. It's time, Rinea. Come with me. We'll hold our wedding atop his funeral!

Alm: Berkut!

## BerkutFinal_Scene
[Berkut]
Nnngh...
[Alm]
Why, Berkut? To have finally found family after all this time... Why did it come to this?!
[Berkut]
Heh... I have no family... nor do I want for one. Now stop talking and finish this. End me, and you can stand alone as inheritor of Rigel's royal blood.
[Alm]
I never wanted that! Don't you get it? I've spent enough of my life alone!
[Berkut]
...The fate of a great man... is to have no one he might call a friend. Power is... the loneliest of burdens. I grow... weary of carrying it. Now... take it from me.
[Alm]
I'll carry it WITH you! It doesn't have to be this way, Berkut! We can put this all behind us and move on-- together-- You have to live. You HAVE to--
[Berkut]
So you see fit even to take away my chance... to die at the hand of an honorable warrior. Must I do everything... by myself? Ghrgh--!!
[Alm]
Berkut, no! Please!! I don't want to be alone again! Help me rebuild Rigel! Tell me about my father!
[Berkut]
You're not... a child anymore, Alm... You must make Valentia a land not of gods... but of men. A world where people never again... are corrupted by divine power... You can do it... without me. I know... you...
[Alm]
Berkut! Berkut... Why? Someone please tell me... I never got to know you... or my father... ...
