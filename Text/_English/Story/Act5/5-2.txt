But how could the goddess[NL]
have been turned to stone?[AN]

Only the sacred blade can seal[NL]

Don't worry.[.4] But--[AN]

Ahh...[.4] So this is Alm.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
Who are you?![AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
My name is Jedah.[AN][2NL]
I must thank you for disposing[NL]
of Rigel's blasphemous Emperor.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well then, Jedah.[AN][2NL]
Enjoy your last moments--[.4]I'm here to[NL]
put an end to you AND to Duma.[AN]
I'll see Zofia restored to Celica![AN]
[Right][LoadCelica_Sad]
Alm, you can't. [MoveRight]You mustn't![AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[.4] Why not?[AN]
[Right]
If Duma is gone, Rigel's lands will[NL]
turn as barren as Zofia's have.[AN]
Even more people will starve.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
But Celica, we can't let--[AN]
[Right]
And even if you still wanted[NL]
to slay Duma, you can't...[AN]
Nothing can stop him now that Mila has[NL]
chosen to seal Falchion away with her.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?![.4][LoadAlm_Sad] But then... all this fighting.[NL]
What was it even for...?[.4] Father...[AN]
[Right]
Alm...[AN]
[FarRight]
Alm and Anthiese...[.4] You stand at the[NL]
pinnacle of your respective kingdoms.[AN]
The hour is come for the world of man[NL]
to return to the gods' control.[AN]
It is the dawn of a new age of order,[NL]
sheltered beneath Duma's great shield.[AN]
Rejoice, Anthiese--[.4]for you have the[NL]
honor of serving as its cornerstone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica[Beat]? What is he talking about?[AN]
[Right][CloseEyes]
[Beat][OpenEyes]This is the only way.[NL]
There's no other choice.[AN]
[FarRight]
The girl will offer up her soul to[NL]
quell the madness in Duma's heart.[AN]
She does so for the sake of Rigel[NL]
and Zofia's people both.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
What?![.4] No![.4] Celica, you can't![NL]
Tell me he's lying![AN]
[Right]
[Beat]It's true,[.4] Alm.[.4] I didn't want[NL]
you to find out this way, but...[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[FarRight]
As promised,[.4] I shall grant you[NL]
sufficient time for a farewell.[AN]
Do not take too long.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Celica, this is crazy![NL]
You can't do this![AN]
I'm going to get you out[NL]
of here.[.4][MoveMidLeft] Just hold on![AN]
[Right]
You don't understand, Alm.[NL]
I came here knowing what awaited me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]What?[AN]
[Right]
Back on the island,[.4] I had a dream where[NL]
something terrible happened to you.[AN]
With all that had gone wrong in Zofia,[NL]
that dream was what finally pushed me[AN]
to seek Mila out--[.4]to petition her for the[NL]
strength to protect you from that fate.[AN]
Yet for all my travels, you've still[NL]
faced terrible danger.[.4] You were even[AN]
forced to end your own father's life.[AN]
...I'd seen it all,[.4] in that dream.[NL]
I knew it was coming,[.4] but in the end,[AN]
I couldn't change a thing.[NL][MoveRight]
I failed to keep you safe, Alm![AN]
Because of that...[.4] I acted so cold.[NL]
I'm sorry.[.4] The truth is,[.4] I've always...[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm_Sad]
That's enough.[.4] I understand.[.4] Celica,[NL]
none of what's happened is your fault.[AN]
You're not to blame for any of it![AN]
[Right]
But I won't lose you.[.4] I won't let[NL]
any of you die.[.4] I don't want[AN]
anyone to be harmed or killed.[AN]
That's my only desire in this life.[AN]
And this is the only means I have[NL]
of ensuring that comes to pass.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica![AN]
[Right][MoveFarRight]
Alm...[.4] I wish it could have been[NL]
different.[.4] I always have.[AN]
I wish I could have gone home to[NL]
the village and lived there with you.[AN][ClearFace]

Emperor Rudolf bade us defeat Duma,[.4] but[NL]
Princess Anthiese asked us not to.[AN]
Have we come this far simply to[NL]
reach an impasse and accept it?[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadLukas]

You're no longer just the[NL]

Alm![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Oh,[.4] come on![NL]
What's wrong with personal feelings?![AN]
All of you fought this far because you[NL]

It's man's individual hopes and fears[NL]
that shape the world.[.4] That drive it.[AN]
And that's how it SHOULD be.[NL]

You're right,[.4] of course,[.4] but...[AN]

Are you prepared to inflict that fate[NL]
upon the world?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadAlm]
I will dedicate my life as emperor to[NL]
ensuring such a thing doesn't happen.[AN]
And yes,[.4] I know as well as anyone that[NL]
there will be losses along the way.[AN]
I think I've learned that much by now.[AN]

See well Falchion,[.4] which you now hold.[AN]
