Is that really the Earth Mother?[AN]
But how could the goddess[NL]

Only the sacred blade can seal[NL]

Alm...[.4] They're safe, too.[.4] Don't worry.[NL]
I'm...[.4] happy to see you.[.4] But--[AN]
[FarRight][LoadJedah][ToggleSmile]
Ahh...[.4] So this is Alm.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
Who are you?![AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
My name is Jedah.[.4] I must thank you for[NL]
disposing of that blasphemous Emperor.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well then, Jedah.[AN][2NL]
Enjoy your last moments--[.4]I'm here to[NL]
put an end to you AND to Duma.[AN]
I'll see Zofia restored to Celica![AN]
[Right][LoadCelica_Sad]
Alm, you can't. [MoveRight]You mustn't![AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[.4] Why not?[AN]
[Right]
If Duma is gone, Rigel's lands will[NL]
turn as barren as Zofia's have.[AN]
Even more people will starve.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
But Celica, we can't let--[AN]
[Right]
And even if you still wanted[NL]
to slay Duma, you can't...[AN]
Nothing can stop him now that Mila has[NL]
chosen to seal Falchion away with her.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What?![.4][LoadAlm_Sad] But then... all this fighting.[NL]
What was it even for...?[.4] Father...[AN]
[Right]
Alm...[AN]
[FarRight]
Alm and Anthiese...[.4] You stand at the[NL]
pinnacle of your respective kingdoms.[AN]
The hour is come for the world of man[NL]
to return to the gods' control.[AN]
It is the dawn of a new age of order,[NL]
sheltered beneath Duma's great shield.[AN]
Rejoice, Anthiese--[.4]for you have the[NL]
honor of serving as its cornerstone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica[Beat]? What is he talking about?[AN]
[Right][CloseEyes]
[Beat][OpenEyes]This is the only way.[NL]
There's no other choice.[AN]
[FarRight]
The girl will offer up her soul to[NL]
quell the madness in Duma's heart.[AN]
She does so for the sake of Rigel[NL]
and Zofia's people both.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm_Angry][MoveMidLeft]
What?![.4] No![.4] Celica, you can't![NL]
Tell me he's lying![AN]
[Right]
[Beat]It's true, Alm.[.4] I didn't want[NL]
you to find out this way, but...[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[FarRight]
As promised, I shall grant you[NL]
sufficient time for a farewell.[AN]
Do not take too long, now.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Celica, this is crazy![NL]
You can't do this![AN]
I'm going to get you out[NL]
of here.[.4][MoveMidLeft] Just hold on![AN]
[Right]
You don't understand, Alm.[NL]
I came here knowing what awaited me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...What?[AN]
[Right]
Back on the island,[.4] I had a dream where[NL]
something terrible happened to you.[AN]
With all that had gone wrong in Zofia,[NL]
that dream was what finally pushed me[AN]
to seek Mila out--[.4]to petition her for the[NL]
strength to protect you from that fate.[AN]
Yet for all my travels, you've still[NL]
faced terrible danger.[.4] You were even[AN]
forced to end your own father's life.[AN]
...I'd seen it all,[.4] in that dream.[NL]
I knew it was coming,[.4] but in the end,[AN]
I couldn't change a thing.[NL][MoveRight]
I failed to keep you safe, Alm![AN]
Because of that...[.4] I acted so cold.[NL]
I'm sorry.[.4] The truth is,[.4] I've always...[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAlm_Sad]
That's enough.[.4] I understand.[.4] Celica,[NL]
none of what's happened is your fault.[AN]
You're not to blame for any of it![AN]
[Right]
But I won't lose you.[.4] I won't let[NL]
any of you die.[.4] Not my friends,[AN]
not my people,[.4] not my brother,[NL]
not Grandpapa,[.4] and not you.[AN]
I don't want anyone to be hurt,[NL]
starved, or killed.[AN]
That's my only desire in this life.[AN]
And this is the only means I have[NL]
of ensuring that comes to pass.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Celica![AN]
[Right][MoveFarRight]
Alm...[.4] I wish it could have been[NL]
different.[.4] I always have.[AN]
I wish I could have gone home to[NL]
the village and lived there with you.[AN][ClearFace]

Well, what is the proper[NL]
course of action for us now?[AN]
Emperor Rudolf bade us defeat Duma,[.4] but[NL]
Princess Anthiese asked us not to.[AN]
Have we come this far simply to[NL]
reach an impasse and accept it?[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadLukas]
One thing seems abundantly[NL]

The chances of Zofia's recovery[NL]
are nearly extinguished.[AN]
With Mila in her current state,[NL]
there is little hope of change.[AN]
[Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][.4]

[FarLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveFarLeft]
Are you serious, Tobin?![AN]
You're going to just sit around on[NL]

So we're going to take down Duma[NL]

[Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadClive]
Consider your position, Alm.[AN]
You're no longer just the[NL]

You are to be Rigel's next emperor.[AN]
You must set your own feelings aside,[NL]
no matter how difficult it may be.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Alm![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Oh,[.4] come on![NL]
What's wrong with personal feelings?![AN]
All of you fought this far because you[NL]
hold some kind of hope for the world.[AN]
It's man's individual hopes and fears[NL]
that shape the world.[.4] That drive it.[AN]
And that's how it SHOULD be.[NL]
I truly believe that.[AN]
Should we let the world crumble[NL]
on a god's whim?[.4] Or his absence?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're right,[.4] of course,[.4] but...[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't want to lose anyone else[NL]
I care about.[.4] I don't want to see[AN]
anyone else lost because of Duma.[NL]

Even if we escape from Duma's control,[NL]
a starving people can know no peace.[AN]

on the weakest and most vulnerable.[AN]
Are you prepared to inflict that fate[NL]
upon the world?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadAlm]
I will dedicate my life as emperor to[NL]
ensuring such a thing doesn't happen.[AN]
And yes,[.4] I know as well as anyone that[NL]
there will be losses along the way.[AN]
I think I've learned that much by now.[AN]
But when I think of the years to come,[NL]
I don't want this.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I want to leave behind a world where[NL]
we shape our lives by our own hands.[AN]
Where we make our own mistakes and[NL]
fix them--[.4]as many times as necessary.[AN]
That's a world worthy of a future.[AN]

???: Hear me, bearer of Duma's Brand. Grasp Falchion now in your hand.

Jedah: What's this? What is the boy doing? Impossible! No one should be able to unbind that blade!

???: Trust in Falchion.

Alm: Celica! Oh, Celica, thank goodness you're okay... But how...?

Celica: Ha... I don't know either. But I heard a voice. A very...kind voice. It said everything would be all right, and to have faith in Falchion. Alm, look--what is that?

Mila: Alm... Anthiese. Children of fate, bearers of the Brand...

Alm: That voice!

(Mila appears)

Mila: I am Mila. Your kind call me [0x93]goddess[0x94]. Together with my brother Duma, I shaped this land.

Alm: Earth Mother!

Mila: Some have called me by that name... But no such power remains within me.

Alm: What?

Mila: See well Falchion, which you now hold. It was carved from the fang of Naga, ruler of dragons, to sever the gods. For Naga knew there was but a creeping madness waiting at eternity's end. It is a ruin all dragons share. And the only end is one of total destruction. Thus it was that Naga bestowed Falchion upon Duma. She did so to prepare for the day our madness would drive the land to ruin, that the people might have a means to destroy us. That Falchion might become the fangs they lack...and the hope they deserve. And yet, in my foolishness, I sealed the blade away. I did it to protect my brother... I loved my brother, even as we loved mankind. Where we strayed, I cannot remember.

Alm: Mila...

Mila: Alm. Anthiese. Children of fate... You have overcome much to reach me here, and I thank you both. You have shown me the strength possessed by mankind. Perhaps men have long been walking on their own without our aid. Perhaps I simply refused to see it. And alas, Duma was no different. I entrust Falchion to your care. I pray you will use it to free my brother from the depths of his pain.

(Mila disappears)

Celica: Mila!

Alm: ...Let's go, Celica. We have to save Duma, for her sake and ours.

Celica: Alm, I...

Alm: Listen, Celica. I know you sacrificed your own life to protect me and the others. But I never wanted that. I couldn't ever be happy in a world you died to create!

Celica: Oh, Alm... I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

Alm: Don't apologize. Just know that I need you, all right? Without your wisdom, all I know how to do is fight whatever's in front of me. So please... Will you fight with me? Believe in me. Believe in US. Believe in our combined strength!

Celica: I do. It's as Mila said... We've had the strength to live and fight for our world this whole time. I lost faith in that somewhere along the way... But right now, it seems the most obvious thing in the world. I trust in mankind like I trust in you, Alm. Absolutely, and without hesitation.

Alm: I feel the same, Celica. This isn't where things end for us. Even without gods, this world has a long and prosperous future ahead of it. Now let's go claim that future together!
