Celica![.4] That's really you,[.4] right?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica][MoveMidLeft]
Mae![.4] Everyone![.4] You're safe![AN]
You have no idea how[NL]
happy this makes me.[AN]
[FarRight]
Right back at ya,[.4] sister![AN]
That chump Jedah's magic threw[NL]
us all out of the tower.[AN]
We had to fight our way back here.[AN]
We were surrounded by Terrors and[NL]
junk--[.4][MoveFarRight]I thought we were dead meat![AN]
[Right]
It was a narrow victory,[.4] I must admit.[AN]
But your friends are as strong[NL]
as they are loyal,[.4] Anthiese.[AN]
I owe them an eternal debt.[.4] They dug me[AN]
out from the depths of despair and set me[NL]
back onto my steed to fight on for you.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Don't sell yourself short,[.4] Conrad![AN]
Without your directions,[.4] we'd have[NL]
gotten lost faster than old Nomah![AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha![.4] I've missed your jokes, Mae.[AN]
Now let's finish this,[.4] together--[NL]
for the sake of Mila's last wish![AN]

Anthiese![.4] Anthiese,[.4] you're alive![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
Conrad![.4] Everyone![.4] You're safe![AN]
You have no idea how[NL]
happy this makes me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Jedah's spell cast us from the tower.[AN]
We had to carve our return through[NL]
countless hordes of Terrors.[AN]
It was a narrow victory,[.4] I must admit.[AN]
But your friends are as strong[NL]
as they are loyal,[.4] Anthiese.[AN]
I owe them an eternal debt.[.4] They dug me[AN]
out from the depths of despair and set me[NL]
back onto my steed to fight on for you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And I owe my comrades as well,[AN]
for coming to my aid with my only[NL]
brother safely in their ranks.[AN]
Now let's finish this,[.4] together--[NL]
for the sake of Mila's last wish![AN]

[MidRight][LoadJedah_Angry]
No...[.5] No,[.4] this cannot happen![NL]
Falchion's seal,[.4] broken?[AN][MoveMidRight]
Foul Mila![.4] Duma is your brother![NL]
Would you truly betray your own kin?![AN]
[FarLeft]
Stand down,[.4] Jedah![NL]
Your schemes end here and now.[AN]
Prepare to pay for your atrocities![AN]
[MidRight]
Rudolf's worthless spawn...[NL]
You're both disgusting heretics.[AN][MoveMidRight]
How dare you wish harm on Duma?![AN]
[Left]
Open your eyes,[.4] Jedah.[AN]
No matter how it pains you,[NL]
you must see the truth.[AN]
Duma's gone mad--[.4]he brings only[NL]
suffering to his people now.[AN]
This is the divine dragons' fate.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Silence,[.4] girl![NL]
You know nothing of what you speak.[AN]
And if suffering is the gods' will,[NL]
what of it?[.4] Without their strength[AN]
at its foundation,[NL]
Valentia cannot sustain life.[AN]
[FarLeft]
No.[.4] You're wrong.[.4] It's time for[NL]
us all to stand on our own feet.[AN]
To live as free people.[AN]
[MidRight]
Foolish boy![.4] You truly believe[NL]
such heresy to be possible?[AN]
[Left]
It IS possible![.4] We've come[NL]
all this way to prove it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Presumptuous human child[Beat][NL]
Go on,[.4] then![.4] Prove me wrong![AN]
Show me this strength to [0x93]stand alone.[0x94][NL]
Show me the true limits of man![AN]

Such naughty,[NL]
willful children...[AN]
Why won't you be good[NL]

Do you really...[NL]

Such lost[Beat][CloseEyes][NL]

[MidLeft][LoadHestia]
That's no fair,[.4] Sonya...[NL]
Why should you be[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadHestia]
Oh[Beat] It seems so...[CloseEyes][NL]
obvious now.[AN]
I should have just[NL]

## Final_Duma_FinalBlow
[MidRight][LoadAlm_Angry]
It's over,[.4] Duma![NL]
Berkut,[.4] Fernand,[.4] Mila...[AN]
Even my father.[NL]
They and countless others,[AN]
lost to us--[.4]tainted[NL]
by your precious power.[AN]
But that chain of[NL]
tragedies ends here.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadCelica_Sad]
My heart is full of thanks[NL]
for all you've given man,[AN]
O divine Duma.[NL]
Without yours and Mila's[AN]
bounty,[.4] Valentia could[NL]
never have existed.[AN]
We would never have been[NL]
born into this world.[AN]
Never tasted joy and sorrow.[AN]
So please,[.4] do not[NL]
suffer any longer.[AN]
Let all of our pain end here.[AN]
Allow your great and weary[NL]
soul the rest it deserves![A]
[X]

## Duma_Refill
[MidLeft][LoadAlm][MoveMidLeft]
What just happened?![AN]
[MidRight][LoadCelica]
That power...[.4] It's like the one[NL]
that Jedah used for protection.[AN]
Duma is using the last of[NL]
his strength to shield himself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
He's caused us all enough suffering.[NL]
I won't let him drag this out![AN]
[MidRight]
Let's end this, Alm.[NL][MoveMidRight]
As Mila bade us:[.4] trust in Falchion![AN]

## Ch5_3_EndingText
[FarLeft][LoadDuma]
So be it.[.4] I leave Valentia's[NL]
future to you both,[.4] her heroes.[AN]
Take from us what lessons you will and[NL]
shape her into a land to remember.[AN]
Make her strong like Duma,[NL]
and fill her with Mila's love.[AN]
Let our grave mistakes be warnings of[NL]
where not to tread as you lead her forth.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.6][.6]
Now,[.4] we shall sleep.[AN]
And never shall you[NL]
disturb our slumber.[AN]

[Beat][CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadCelica_Coronation][ToggleSmile][.6][MoveFarLeft]
So this is where you were.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes][MoveMidRight]
Huh?[.4] Oh,[.4] hey, Celica.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
You aren't going to be late to[NL]
your own coronation,[.4] are you?[AN]
[MidRight]
No.[.4] ...Of course not.[AN]
I'm just still wrapping my head around[NL]
sitting on your father's throne.[AN][MoveMidRight]
Your throne.[.6] None of it feels real.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...It isn't my throne,[NL]
or that of my father.[AN]
This isn't Zofia any longer,[.4] Alm.[NL]
It's the One Kingdom of Valentia.[AN]
And you're going to be its first king.[NL]
You have as much right to it as I.[AN]
[MidRight]
Celica...[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Please don't misunderstand.[.5] I don't[NL]
bear my father any grudge.[.5] Not now.[AN]
I just think he was a very sad man.[AN][CloseEyes]
Perhaps if I'd been there with him,[NL]
I might have helped him change.[AN][OpenEyes]
If I have any regrets,[.4] it's that.[AN]
[MidRight]
I know what you mean[Beat] Neither of us[NL]
got the chance to stand by our fathers.[AN]
If we'd been given the opportunity[NL]
to learn more about each other,[AN]
maybe things would've turned out[NL]
differently for us.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Perhaps it was the same[NL]
for Mila and Duma.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hmm[Beat] I wonder.[.4] They'd been[NL]
fighting for centuries,[.4] right?[AN]
Seems like a lost cause to me.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Alm![.4] That's a terrible thing to say![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ah,[.4] sorry![NL]
I didn't mean any disrespect.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But they're at peace now,[NL]
you know?[.5] Asleep.[.5] ...Together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes.[.4] They'll look down over[NL]
this new Valentia forever[AN]
from their mountaintop graves.[AN]
[Beat]And the trees.[NL]
Do you know of them,[.4] Alm?[AN]
They say that where divine dragons[NL]
sleep,[.4] sacred trees take root and grow.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wow.[.4] Must be some trees.[AN]
[MidLeft]
In time,[.4] yes.[.5] They grow for hundreds,[NL]
even thousands of years.[AN]
Who can say what Valentia will[NL]
look like once they've matured?[AN]
Will man's endeavors continue without[NL]
the grace and strength of the gods?[AN]
[MidRight]
They won't continue on their own.[NL]
We have to make it happen.[AN]
We'll forge a land where we can do[NL]
just that.[.5] All of us--[.4]together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That sounds lovely, Alm.[NL]
And you're right.[AN]
I know we can do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
We can[Beat] and we will.[AN]
I think Mila and Duma[NL]
gave us one last gift...[AN]
The strength to trust[NL]
in our own abilities.[AN]
[Beat][MoveMidRight]Anyway,[.4] it's time.[NL]
Let's go,[.4] Celica.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Gladly.[AN]
[X]

## Ch5_3_Epilogue_Narration
And so the long war drew to a close.[AN]
After countless sacrifices,[.4] at last,[NL]
a new peace dawned in Valentia.[AN]
Was it inexorable fate that saw this[NL]
conflict erupt?[.4] None alive can say.[AN]
Only one truth is clear:[AN]
War will come again,[.4] when man grows[NL]
proud and slothful once more,[.4] and[AN]
its flames will devour one and all,[NL]
raging until the very earth itself[AN]
lies scorched and bare of life.[AN]
For whatever madness lay[NL]
in the hearts of gods...[AN]
a darkness deeper still beats wild[NL]
in the hearts of man...[A]
