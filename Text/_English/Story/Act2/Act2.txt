[FarRight][LoadMycenSepia]
Are you certain, Celica?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes.[.4] You saw the face he made[NL]
when you told him I had to leave.[AN]
If I try to say good-bye to him,[CloseEyes][NL]
I'll just end up crying.[AN][OpenEyes]
Grandp--[.4] Er, Sir Mycen?[NL]
Where will I go next?[AN]
[FarRight]
Hmm... I have a place in mind.[AN]
Perhaps it's time to call on[NL]
an old friend.[AN]
Under his care, I am certain[NL]
your enemies will never find you.[AN][CloseEyes]
Forgive an old knight[NL]
for failing you, Princess.[AN]
Had the Mother willed it...[AN]
I would have stayed by your side[NL]
and protected you to my dying days.[AN][OpenEyes]
But I cannot leave Ram Village.[NL]
Not yet, at least.[AN]
[MidRight]
You don't need to apologize,[NL]
Sir Mycen. I regret nothing.[AN]
The days I spent here with[NL]
you and Alm were wonderful.[AN]
The experiences I had and the friends[NL]
I made all mean the world to me.[AN]
You don't have to be my[NL]
shining knight, Sir Mycen--[AN]
you just have to promise to[NL]
always be my grandpapa.[AN]
[FarRight]
Of course.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadAlmYoung]
CELICA![AN]

...Alm?[AN]

Alm! You came for me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I want to make a new promise.[AN]
One day, when I'm older and stronger,[NL]
I'm going to find you.[AN]
It doesn't matter where the world[NL]
hides you or how long it takes.[AN]
I promise to find you.[NL]
[MidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
So please[Beat] don't forget me, okay?[AN]
[Right]
I could never forget you, Alm.[AN]
And I promise too.[.4] I'll be waiting[NL]
for the day we can meet again.[AN]
[Beat]But for now, I have to go.[AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight]

[FarFarLeft][ClearFace][.5]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Grandpapa?[AN]
[FarRight]
Yes, child?[AN]
[MidRight]
...Do you think I'll[NL]
ever see him again?[AN]
[FarRight]
I do. So long as destiny wills it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Destiny[Beat][CloseEyes] So be it.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadGenny]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Gah![.4] That infernal bell is so--[NL]
Why are they clanging it now?![AN]
[Right]
Apparently the king's passed[Beat][NL]
That's what Nomah said, anyway.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The king? But isn't that[Beat][NL]
He was Celica's...[AN]
[FarRight]
Oh dear[Beat] I hope she's[NL]
dealing with this okay...[AN]
[X]

##CelicaHandoffScene_2
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[MidRight][LoadNomah]
[MidRight]
You're certain I can't dissuade you[NL]
from going, little one?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I must, Nomah.[.5] It's been years[NL]
since crops last grew on Zofian soil.[AN]
Our barren fields have fallen[NL]
victim to Terrors,[AN]
the Rigelians have invaded...[NL]
I fear some ill must have befallen[AN]
the Earth Mother, Mila.[NL]
I know this must be connected.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm...[.5] Perhaps it is, at that.[NL]
I'll not deny that the kingdom[AN]
of Zofia faces her darkest hour[NL]
in some time.[.5] More sick and hungry[AN]
come to the priory's door[NL]
each day seeking aid...[AN]
[MidLeft]
The key to everything lies with Mila.[AN]
I shall travel to her temple[NL]
and learn what's become of her.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, but little one...[NL]
You know well the reason Mycen placed[AN]
you in my care.[.5] With the king's passing,[NL]
you are the last living member[AN]
of the Zofian royal line.[NL]
There are many who would seek to use you.[AN]
Or even end you. That threat is[NL]
greater now than ever.[AN]
Yet you would still leave, knowing that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I must.[.5] Even if my decision betrays[NL]
the care you and Mycen have shown me.[AN]
You've done so much to keep me safe,[NL]
and it breaks my heart to pain you.[AN]
But this goes beyond my heart.[NL]
I can only ask your forgiveness.[AN]
[MidRight]
Keep your plea of forgiveness, child.[NL]
I'll not give what isn't required.[AN]
If this is your mind, I won't object.[NL]
Trust in it as I trust in you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Nomah.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh. Of course.[AN]
But you must take care--[.4]the blight[NL]
in Zofia is worse than you know.[AN]
You've uncommon talent as a warrior[NL]
priestess, but carelessness is fatal.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Nomah.[.5] For everything.[NL]
Well then, I think I'll be on my way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm?[.4] You're leaving this very instant?[NL]
Surely you can stay until the bell's[AN]
last peal?[.5] It rings to mourn your[NL]
father's passing, as you know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll never think of that man as[NL]
my father.[.5] Now if you'll excuse me...[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Little one...[.5] May you walk always[NL]
in the light of Mila's blessing.[AN]
[X]

##CelicaHandoffScene_3

[Right][LoadMae]
[FarRight][LoadBoey]
[Right]
Celica![.4] I heard the news![NL]
You're going to the Temple of Mila,[AN]
right?[.5] If so, then I'm going too.[NL]
You can't say no![AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[.4] Thanks, Mae.[NL]
To be honest, I'd welcome the help.[AN]
[FarRight]
Good, because I'm coming too.[AN]
I'm not letting the two of you[NL]
go off on your own.[AN]
[Right]
[0x93]Letting[0x94] us?[.5] Heh, you say that like[NL]
you think you can keep us safe.[AN]
[FarRight]
I do![.4] And I can![.4] I'll be more help[NL]
than you, at least.[AN]
[Right]
Uh, rude?[.4] AND wrong![NL]
I can conjure lightning, Boey.[AN]
Big, hurty lightning.[NL]
What've you got, fire?[AN]
Maybe I'll call you if I[NL]
want to roast marshmallows.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Let's just say you'd both be a great[NL]
help and leave it at that, shall we?[AN]
I know I'll be counting on you both.[NL]
This isn't going to be an easy journey.[AN]
Still, I'm glad I'll have good company.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadGenny]
[MidRight]
Celica?[.4] Can I[Beat] go with you too?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course, Genny...[NL]
I didn't think you'd ask.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat] it's true I like to be alone[Beat][NL]
but not ALL alone.[AN]
I'd like to help out, if I can.[AN]
I brought some things from the pantry[NL]
that might be useful on the road.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
[Right][LoadBoey]
[FarRight][LoadMae][ToggleSmile]
Sweet jumping jesters![NL]
Now THIS is a castle![AN]
It's huge![.4] I mean, huuuuuge![NL]
And it's GORGEOUS![AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Keep it down, would you, Mae?[AN]
We're not here to gawk at the sights[NL]
like a band of slack-jawed wayfarers.[AN]
[FarRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Whatever, Professor Funslayer.[NL][OpenEyes]
Even YOU have to admit it's great.[AN]
[Right]
I never said it wasn't impressive.[AN]
A far cry from the ramshackle fishing[NL]
huts we grew up in, that's for sure.[AN]
[FarRight]
I know, right?![.4] Can you imagine[NL]
living in a place like this?[AN]
With servants and meat pies and--[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
A-HEM...[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
[FarRight]
...Oh, riiight.[AN]
Shoot, Celica, I'm really sorry.[NL]
I didn't mean to--[AN]
Actually, you know what?[NL]
I think we'll just go on ahead![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Right, you do that.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[.....]
[FarRight][LoadSaber]
What's goin' on here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What do you mean?[AN]
[FarRight]
Those two's eyes near fell out[NL]
when they saw this place,[AN]
but you ain't impressed.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
What?[.4] N-[.4]no, I'm very impressed.[NL]
Speechless, actually.[.4] That's all.[AN]
[FarRight]
Uh-huh.[AN]
Well, whatever you say, lass.[NL]
Let's get inside already.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][CloseEyes]
I never thought I'd set foot[NL]
in these halls again...[AN]
But this is to see Alm[Beat][NL]
And in that case...[AN]
...Enough.[.4] I need to hurry.[AN]
[X]

##Ch2_Epilogue2
[MidLeft][LoadArcanist]
Damn that one-eyed vermin![NL]
Fie and fie again![AN]
Now I must explain to Jedah[NL]
how we failed to secure the girl.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarFarRight][LoadSlayde]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
...Beg pardon, friend.[NL]
You with the Rigelian Army, perchance?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Grr...[.4] Who asks such of me?![AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Soft, friend, soft![NL]
I'm not your enemy.[AN]
I was working under Desaix,[AN]
but those damned rebels[NL]
ran us out of the castle.[AN]
I was thinking I might[NL]
defect to Rigel...[AN]
in exchange for my services,[NL]
of course.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh. And you expect me to trust a man[NL]
who so utterly lacks shame?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You sure you can afford not to?[AN]
You just got your scrawny hides kicked[NL]
trying to kidnap one little girl.[AN]
You really want to go back to[NL]
the boss-man empty-handed?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hrm...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
See, I know about this little forest[NL]
northwest of Zofia Castle.[AN]
And in this forest,[NL]
there's a village...[AN]

##Ch2_Epilogue3
[FarLeft][LoadMycen]
[FarFarRight][LoadCelica]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight]
...Grandpapa?![NL]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's been so very long, Celica.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Oh, Grandpapa![AN]
I'd half resigned myself to[NL]
never seeing you again.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As had I.[.4] And yet here you are,[NL]
grown into an independent young woman.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Though I fear we lack the time[NL]
for a leisurely reunion.[AN]
Surely you left the island with[NL]
some purpose in mind, yes?[AN]
[MidRight]
I did.[NL]
I'm going to the Temple of Mila.[AN]
All that's transpiring in Zofia now[NL]
is tied to the Earth Mother--[AN]
I can feel it in my very marrow.[AN]
There's more to be done than simply[NL]
fighting the foes laid before us.[AN]
I must learn Mila's will[NL]
in all of this.[AN]
I also intend to pray that she[NL]
intercedes on behalf of her people.[AN]
That she might save us all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see.[AN]
Just as Alm has chosen his path,[NL]
it would seem you have chosen yours.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm?![.4] I'd suspected as much,[NL]
but your being here confirms it...[AN]
He's leading the Deliverance,[NL]
isn't he?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why don't you go upstairs[NL]
and see for yourself?[AN]
I expect that's where you'll find[NL]
what you've been searching for.[AN]
[X]

##Ch2_Epilogue4
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
Hmm?[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadCelica][ToggleSmile]
It's really you![AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wha--?![AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveLeft][CloseEyes][......]
[Left][OpenEyes][MoveRight]
[MidLeft]
Wait a sec...[.4] Celica?[NL][MoveLeft]
Is that really you?[.4] Celica?![AN]
[Right]
Alm[Beat] I'm so glad to see you...[AN]
I have dreamt about this day[NL]
for seven years--[AN]
At last[Beat] I've finally found you![AN]
[Left]
You have.[NL]
I've missed you too[Beat] so much.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Wow.[.4] That's quite the story.[AN]
I'm trying to picture you[NL]
swashbuckling pirates, and...[AN]
Yeah. Just[Beat] wow.[AN]
[Right]
I didn't mean to swashbuckle anyone.[NL]
It just sort of[Beat] happened.[AN]
But forget all that for the moment.[AN]
Alm, you aren't REALLY planning to[NL]
fight the Rigelian Empire, are you?[AN]
[Left]
Listen, it's not[Beat][NL]
It's not something I chose.[AN]
They were the ones who attacked us.[AN]
[Right]
But there must be a way[NL]
to resolve things[AN]
other than with bloodshed, no?[AN]
[Left]
That's a pretty thought, Celica,[NL]
but I'm not sure it's true.[AN]
If it were, no one would be risking[NL]
life and limb on the battlefield.[AN]
[Right]
Is it really so naive?[AN]
Zofians and Rigelians are both[NL]
people of Valentia, are we not?[AN]
I know we can reach some kind of[NL]
accord if we just try![AN]
Besides that, I...[AN]
I just can't imagine Emperor Rudolf is[NL]
the monster some claim him to be.[AN]
[Left]
It doesn't matter[NL]
what sort of man he is.[AN]
The Rigelian Empire chose to[NL]
cross Zofia's border--[.4]that's a fact.[AN]
We aim to drive back the invaders.[NL]
Nothing more.[AN]
[Right]
But why do YOU have to[NL]
lead this rebellion?[AN]
Mycen's grandson or no,[NL]
you're neither knight nor noble.[AN]
So why make yourself[NL]
a target like this?![AN]
[Left]
Nrgh... If I didn't know any better,[NL]
I'd swear I was speaking to a noble.[AN]
My station doesn't matter, Celica.[NL]
I'm here because I was called.[AN]
I have a duty to perform,[NL]
and I'll perform it.[AN]
No more, and no less.[AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight][MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Oh, Alm...[AN]
[Left]
Do you think I WANTED this fight?[AN]
This all started because Lima IV[NL]
went and angered the empire.[AN]
If you wish to point fingers, point[NL]
at the ruler who failed his people.[AN]
It's his fault we're in this mess.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's not...[NL][OpenEyes]
[MidRight][LoadCelica_Angry]
Well, so what if it is?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Maybe you should go become king[NL]
if it's such a damnably easy job![AN]
[Left]
What?[NL]
Celica, that's not--[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight]
You're awfully free with[NL]
accusations, for someone with[AN]
no idea what royalty entails![AN]
And now that you're a [0x93]hero,[0x94] I imagine[NL]
the throne is next on the list, is it?[AN]
[Left]
No, it's not like that at all, Celica![NL]
I just want to keep Zofia SAFE![AN]
Besides, there's an heir.[.4] A princess[NL]
of the royal family may have survived.[AN]
If she turned up and fixed all this,[NL]
I'd happily return to Ram.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You could[Beat] come with me, you know?[NL]
It'd be like old times.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Come on![.4] There's no secret princess![NL]
The Zofian royal family is dead![AN]
[Left]
But how can you be--[AN]

##Ch2_OrangeCGText
[SetName]Celica[NL]
Enough![NL]
Just...[.4] enough.[AN]
Go fight your war,[NL]
if it makes you happy.[AN]
I'm going to the[NL]
Temple of Mila.[AN]
...Good-bye, Alm.[NL]
You... you stubborn JERK![A][X]

##Ch2_Epilogue5
[Left][LoadAlm]
Celica...[.4] You're one to talk[NL]
about stubbornness, geez...[AN]
Ah, damn it all.[AN]
I didn't even get the chance[NL]
to ask her about the village...[AN]
About why she had to leave.[AN][CloseEyes]
Oh, Celica...[.4] I had so much[NL]
I wanted to say to you.[AN]
How did it end up like this?[AN]
[X]

##Ch2_Epilogue_EndNarration
Alm and Celica's heartfelt reunion[NL]
was dashed by heated words,[AN]
and once again, the two were parted.[AN]
One chose the battlefield...[NL]
the other, the Mother's succor.[AN]
And while they both sought to[NL]
attain peace in their own way,[AN]
their chances of finding it together[NL]
seemed to grow increasingly slim.[A]
