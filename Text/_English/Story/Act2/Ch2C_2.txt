Um,[.4] excuse me,[.4] but--[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah,[.4] lady priestess![.4] Welcome.[NL]
Something I can help you with today?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I need to book passage[NL]
to Zofia Harbor.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hrm...[.4] I'm afraid that's a difficult[NL]
wish to grant,[.4] even for you,[.4] priestess.[AN]
This patch of sea is teeming with[NL]
pirates of late.[.5] It's too dangerous.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh,[.4] that's no good...[AN]
[MidRight]
That being said[Beat] if milady were to do[NL]
something about those pirates...[AN]
Well,[.4] that'd be a different matter[NL]
altogether now,[.4] wouldn't it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You want me to[Beat] fight pirates?[AN]
[MidRight]
They've grown bolder by the day,[NL]
so they have.[.5] And yet,[AN]
His Highness hasn't seen fit[NL]
to send so much as a single man...[AN]
This sea's our love and livelihood.[NL]
We can't live cut off from her.[AN]
Ah,[.4] what's happened to Zofia?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmm...[AN]
[MidRight]
Forgive me,[.4] milady,[.4] but I can't get you[NL]
across the sea while pirates sail it.[AN]
I know I ask much of you,[.4] priestess,[NL]
but if you would lend us your strength?[AN]
If you feel the danger's too great alone,[NL]
perhaps you might court additional aid?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Hmm[Beat] What are we supposed to do now?[AN]
[MidRight]
I can't believe that old timer tossed[NL]
his pirate problem right at our feet![AN]
Do we LOOK like the type to fight[NL]
pirates?[.5] We're delicate little blossoms![AN]
[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Speak for yourself![AN]
[Left]
Regardless,[.4] the man is right.[AN]
We'll not get anywhere until[NL]
ships are free to sail again.[AN]
[FarLeft]
What do you propose,[.4] milady?[AN]
[Left]
Let's gather what help we can find.[NL]
The sea is only the start.[AN]
Zofia is at war,[.4] and ravaged by[NL]
Terrors besides.[.5] We'll not make it[AN]
very far traveling alone.[NL]
We need allies.[.5] Strong ones.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yes,[.4] and mad enough to set sail into[NL]
pirate-infested waters with us...[AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm sure they'll just be lining up[NL]
to take the job.[AN]

You're a mercenary,[.4] yes?[NL]
Saber,[.4] is it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yep.[.4] Who're you,[.4] girl?[AN]
[MidLeft]
My name is Celica.[.5] The people here speak[NL]
quite highly of your skill with a blade.[AN]
I'd like to enlist your[NL]
services as a protector...[AN]
[MidRight]
Guard duty,[.4] eh?[.5] You headed somewhere,[NL]
or is this a local deal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
We seek the Temple of Mila.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's awfully far...[AN]
And I suppose you've already heard[NL]
about our little pirate problem?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's the reason I seek your aid,[.4] in fact.[AN]
Unless you think a few mere pirates[NL]
are too much for you to handle?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] that's real cute.[NL]
Believe me,[.4] lass,[.4] I ain't worried about[AN]
a couple sea rats.[.5] All I'm worried about[NL]
is if you can pay.[AN]
I don't work charity cases.[NL]
Especially when I'm risking my own neck.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm afraid I haven't much money,[NL]
but I do have this.[AN]
[MidRight]
A dagger?[.5] *whistle*[NL]
Well,[.4] ain't you fancy?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Will this be sufficient[NL]
for your services?[AN]
[X]

[MidRight]
You mean will I risk life and limb[NL]
for a single dagger?[.5] Ordinarily,[.4] no.[AN]
BUT[Beat][ToggleSmile] since I like your moxie,[NL]
I'm gonna go ahead and give you a break.[AN]
You got a deal.[NL]
I'll get you to your temple.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wonderful![.4] You have my thanks, Saber.[AN][ClearFace]
[FarFarLeft]
Mae![.4] Boey![.4] Did you hear that?[NL]
He's going to come with us![AN]
[MidRight]
Heh.[.4] This job's got easy money[NL]
written all over it.[AN]
What kind of fool hands over treasure[NL]
like this without batting an eye?[AN]
She really must be daddy's[NL]
spoiled little lass...[AN]

Ah, lady priestess.[.5] You've returned.[AN]
[Left]
I have![.4] And this gentleman,[.4] Saber,[NL]
has agreed to aid us.[AN]
Now may we ask you to set sail?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well then,[.4] I'd be honored to[NL]
do my part,[.4] milady.[AN]
Even if he does smell[NL]
like a tavern floor...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Is that a problem,[.4] sailor?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
N-[.4]not at all![.4] Come aboard.[NL]
We'll depart as soon as you're ready.[AN]

ye scurvy dogs![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Eagh![.4] P-p-pirates![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
These waters belong to Barth,[NL]
the Pirate King,[.4] as yer surely aware![AN]
That means ye needs pay a toll...[NL]
All yer goods and women'll do nicely![AN]
[FarLeft]
An interesting offer[Beat]but I fear[NL]
we must nevertheless decline.[AN]
The sea belongs to no one man--[NL]
she's a gift to every citizen of Zofia.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Yar,[.4] who be the mouthy wench?![AN]
[Left][LoadSaber]
[Left]
Enough with the chit-chat.[AN]
Reason and logic are wasted on[NL]
sea dogs like him.[AN]
Let's just get to business already.[NL]
That's what you hired me for,[.4] ain't it?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Fair enough.[.5] Let's go,[.4] everyone![AN]

Milady,[.4] do you see that[NL]
treasure chest over there?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It must be full of booty.[NL]
[ToggleSmile][Beat]Heh... [0x93]booty.[0x94][AN]
A-[.4]Anyway,[.4] you're suggesting I use[NL]
my Unlock spell on it,[.4] right?[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed,[.4] milady![.5] --And,[.4] if you could[NL]
teach it to me someday,[.4] as well...?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hee hee...[.4] I think you need to work on[NL]
your white magic skills first.[AN]

Oh?[.4] Genny,[.4] are you all right?[NL]
You look pale as a sheet...[AN]
[MidRight]
I...[.4] I had no idea how much blood[NL]
gets shed in a real fight.[AN]
Seeing it makes me a little...[NL]
light-headed.[AN]
It's nothing like the books[NL]
I've read...[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Genny,[.4] if you want to return to[NL]
the priory,[.4] you have every right to.[AN]
I don't want you to[NL]
push yourself too hard.[AN]
[MidRight]
No[Beat][NL]
No,[.4] I'm staying with you,[.4] Celica.[AN]
If we don't find what happened[NL]
to Mother Mila,[AN]
soon there won't be any[NL]
priory to return to.[AN]
Besides...[.4] I don't want to spend the[NL]
rest of forever on one little island.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Thank you,[.4] Genny.[NL]
You're very brave to do this.[AN]
We'll all make sure you're[NL]
safe and taken care of.[AN]
