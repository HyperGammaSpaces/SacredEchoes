...Blerg. I don't like sea travel,[NL]
and it sure doesn't like me.[AN][CloseEyes]
I'm nauseous, I'm sunburned,[NL]
and I'm wind-beaten.[AN][OpenEyes]
I look like death's damp leftovers.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't think any of us[NL]
particularly like it, Leon.[AN]
For whatever it's worth,[NL]
I think you look fine.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Only [0x93]fine[0x94]?[.5] Oh.[.5] Okay.[.5][AN]
For someone who still looks fresh as[NL]
a daisy after weeks at sea, you could[AN]
stand to be a bit more generous to[NL]
those of us less fortunate, Priestess.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Err...[AN]
[FarRight][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadValbar][ToggleSmile]
For all he runs his yap,[AN]
Leon here's one of my best soldiers[NL]
from back in my army days.[AN]
It's a damn good thing his eyes[NL]
are as sharp as his tongue.[AN]
[Right][MoveRight]
Oh, Valbar![.4] Stop it,[NL]
you'll make me blush.[AN]
You can't just say something like[NL]
that without letting me prove it![AN]
Here, Priestess, let me have[NL]
the telescope for a mo'.[AN][MoveRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][MoveRight]
Heh. Just between you 'n me,[AN]
that boy craves attention[NL]
like you and I breathe air.[AN]
He doesn't mean any harm by it,[NL]
so don't let him get under your skin.[AN]
[Beat]He's a good kid.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hee. That's a relief.[NL]
Thank you, Valbar.[AN]
[FarFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Bad news, Priestess![AN]
A ship's approaching from starboard,[NL]
and it's gaining fast.[AN]
[MidLeft]
In this storm?[NL]
Are you sure?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLeon]
Strange as it is, I know what I saw.[AN][MoveRight]
But what kind of absolute drool-bucket[NL]
picks a fight, in heavy downpour,[AN]
with the ship that's LEAVING the[NL]
pirate stronghold in one piece?![AN]
[MidLeft]
May I take a look for myself?[AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
You two figure out the thinking stuff.[NL]
I'll go get folks geared up to fight.[AN][ClearFace]

Milady! There's a ship approaching![AN]
[Left]
In this storm?[NL]
Are you sure?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadSaber]
No, I see it too.[AN]
Can't tell how far away it is,[NL]
but it's getting closer.[AN]
Who'd be mad enough to risk[NL]
capsizing their whole cargo[AN]
just to raid a boat coming from[NL]
an armed pirate stronghold?[AN]
[Left]
This makes no sense...[NL]
Here, may I see that telescope?[AN]
[FarRight]
Knock yourself out, lass,[NL]
but they're moving fast.[AN]
I'll go get folks geared up[NL]
for a fight.[AN][ClearFace]

There's only...[.4] one of them?[NL]
What's going on here?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCantor]
So you're the girl, eh?[NL]
Serving you up on a platter[AN]
will earn me a swift promotion[NL]
within the faith.[AN]
Now that I've washed this place clean of[NL]
pirate vermin, you will come with me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Are you out of your mind, old man?[NL]
We're in a hurry here,[AN]
and you're in our way.[NL]
So would you kindly get out of it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Impudent child...[.5] Such a glib tongue[NL]
will earn you nothing but pain.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh.[.5] Do you honestly plan to[NL]
take us on all by yourself?[AN]
[Left]
Wait a second--[.4]is he?[.5] Oh no...[NL]
Watch out, everyone![.5] He's a cantor![AN]
He means to summon Terrors[NL]
to fight for him![AN]
[FarLeft]
He means to summon...[.4] [MoveFarLeft]Wait, WHAT?![AN]

It's over...[.5] Thank the Mother.[NL]
Milady, what was that all about?[AN]
That creep was talking about...[NL]
serving you up or some such...?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know, Boey.[.5] But he was different[NL]
from the others who have come after me.[AN]
And I fear he won't be the last...[NL]
so we'd best be careful moving forward.[AN]
