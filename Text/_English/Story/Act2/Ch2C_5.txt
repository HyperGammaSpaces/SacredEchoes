Milady! There's a ship approaching![AN]
[Left]
In this storm?[NL]
Are you sure?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadSaber]
No, I see it too.[AN]
Can't tell how far away it is,[NL]
but it's getting closer.[AN]
Who'd be mad enough to risk[NL]
capsizing their whole cargo[AN]
just to raid a boat coming from[NL]
an armed pirate stronghold?[AN]
[Left]
This makes no sense...[NL]
Here, may I see that telescope?[AN]
[FarRight]
Knock yourself out, lass,[NL]
but they're moving fast.[AN]
I'll go get folks geared up[NL]
for a fight.[AN][ClearFace]

There's only...[.4] one of them?[NL]
What's going on here?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCantor]
So you're the girl, eh?[NL]
Serving you up on a platter[AN]
will earn me a swift promotion[NL]
within the faith.[AN]
Now that I've washed this place clean of[NL]
pirate vermin, you will come with me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Are you out of your mind, old man?[NL]
We're in a hurry here,[AN]
and you're in our way.[NL]
So would you kindly get out of it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Impudent child...[.5] Such a glib tongue[NL]
will earn you nothing but pain.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh.[.5] Do you honestly plan to[NL]
take us on all by yourself?[AN]
[Left]
Wait a second--[.4]is he?[.5] Oh no...[NL]
Watch out, everyone![.5] He's a cantor![AN]
He means to summon Terrors[NL]
to fight for him![AN]
[FarLeft]
He means to summon...[.4] [MoveFarLeft]Wait, WHAT?![AN]

It's over...[.5] Thank the Mother.[NL]
Milady, what was that all about?[AN]
That creep was talking about...[NL]
serving you up or some such...?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know, Boey.[.5] But he was different[NL]
from the others who have come after me.[AN]
And I fear he won't be the last...[NL]
so we'd best be careful moving forward.[AN]
