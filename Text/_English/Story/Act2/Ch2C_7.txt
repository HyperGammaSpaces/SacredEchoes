I hadn't realized the situation[NL]
was so dire...[AN]

Mm...[.4] Looks like the remaining[NL]
Barth supporters aren't too happy[AN]
about what we did to their boss.[NL]
And more of those blue freaks, too...[AN]

swarming around the harbor![AN]

By the Mother...[NL]
Even here, there are pirates?[AN]
I hadn't realized the[NL]
situation was so dire...[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh, they still haven't wised up even[NL]
after we keelhauled their captain.[AN]
These stinking pirates...[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLeon]
Ugh, I know, right?[AN]
They should've hightailed it[NL]
while they had the chance,[AN]
but instead they're asking for[NL]
an arrow between the eyes.[AN]
Let's finish what we started, Valbar.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Sounds like a plan to me, fellas![AN]

I'm getting tired of these blue fools.[AN]
If I keep grimacing at their ugly mugs,[NL]
I'll have wrinkles before I'm thirty.[AN]

Whaddya say we smash 'n bash[NL]

##Ch2_7_PostPrep_1
[MidRight][LoadLeon]
What a shame.[AN]
This harbor used to be THE place[NL]
to be in Southern Zofia...[AN]
Good food, good shopping,[NL]
and of course, a great bar scene.[AN]
Now look at it![.4] Ugh.[AN]
These no-good brutes have run everyone[NL]
into their houses.[AN]

##Ch2_7_PostPrep_2
[MidRight][LoadLeon]
We'd better warn the townspeople[NL]
before the pirates get to them.[AN]
And if I know a thing or two[NL]
about sailors--[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadKamui]
Believe me, he does.[NL]
About flirting with 'em, at least.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Uh, RUDE?[AN]
--Anyway, where there's one,[NL]
there's bound to be more on the way.[AN]
Let's keep a sharp eye on[NL]

Didja hear some pirate dogs made for[NL]
Grieth's Citadel with a girl in tow?[AN]
S'truth![.4] A brave sellsword staying at[NL]
the pub even took after the poor dear.[AN]
But Grieth ain't the sort you cross[NL]
and live to speak of.[AN]
Nasty fellow, he is. [Beat]Oh?[NL]
You intend to go off too, don't you?[AN]
Take this ambrosia, then,[NL]
and may it bring you some protection.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadMan1]
From cutpurse to corsair, every thief in[NL]
Zofia answers to a man called Grieth.[AN]
Even the pirate king Barth was but[NL]
one of his henchmen.[AN]
Grieth's citadel stands tall in[NL]
the desert.[.5] Colossal thing, it is![AN]
That's where they hold all the captives[NL]
his men bring as tribute.[AN]
If you're going to deal with him,[NL]
take this axe.[.5] Best of luck.[AN]

It's[Beat]it's like a dream.[NL]
The pirates scuttled?[AN]
Zofia Castle free?[NL]
I keep asking people to pinch--[AN]
[Right]
The castle is freed?[NL]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Didn't you hear?[.5] The Deliverance[NL]

Word is, they have a new leader who led[NL]
the attack himself.[.5] He's a young lad--[AN]

General Mycen.[.5] Whoever he is,[AN]
the boy brought the entire army[NL]
back from the brink.[AN]
[Right]
General Mycen[Beat] Grandpapa?![NL]
Are you certain of this?[AN]
[MidLeft]
'Course I am![.4] Wouldn't do a man to[NL]
repeat baseless rumor, now would it?[AN]
The boy's the talk of the kingdom.[NL]
A hero's grandson turned hero himself![AN]
[Right]
Oh, gods[Beat] Then the person[NL]
leading the Deliverance is[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
It's like the dawn of a new day for us.[NL]
To think, we've got a hero on our side![AN]
The Deliverance forces are holding in[NL]
Zofia Castle for now.[AN]
But there's talk of them taking up[NL]
the march again before long.[AN]
They won't stop till there's nary a[NL]
Rigelian dog left on Zofian soil![AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[LoadOverworldFaces]

Then they mean to march[NL]
on the Rigelian Army...?[AN]
[CloseEyes]Oh, Alm[Beat] How can you[NL]

[MidLeft][LoadBoey]

Er, Celica?[.4] Is everything all right?[NL]
You look pale as a shade.[AN]
Did Boey tell you some stupid[NL]
ghost story again?[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes]
No, I'm[Beat] I'm fine, thank you.[NL]
But[Beat]might we travel to[AN]
Zofia Castle before setting[NL]

There's something I need to[NL]
see for myself there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
At the castle?[AN]
You know we would[NL]
follow you anywhere,[AN]

You know?[AN]
The lovely one who was asking[NL]
after you over at the pub?[AN]
Said something about wanting to give[NL]
whoever sank those pirates her 'thanks.'[AN]

Dreamt I might see you again.[AN]
But please[Beat]not like this.[NL]
