By the mighty parrot of Shanty Pete![NL]
What be that racket?[.5] Yar har ho![AN]
Looks like more little mice be[NL]
squeakin' into me keep![AN]
[Left]
Are you the one they call Barth?[AN]
I order you to halt your piracy[NL]
and leave these waters at once![AN]
[MidRight]
Gar har har![.4] I'll do no such thing,[NL]
ye shrill woman![.5] No one enters the lair[AN]
of the Pirate King and starts[NL]
squawkin' orders but me![AN]
[FarLeft]
You see, lass?[.5] What'd I tell you about[NL]
trying to reason with sea dogs?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yar, bold words from a fool man.[NL]
Well, I'll put yer steel to the test![AN]
Have at 'em, boys![.5] Take the man's guts[NL]
for garters, but leave the wench alive.[AN]
I'll not have a single scratch on her...[NL]
Ruins the sale price, it do![.5] Yar har ho![AN]
[FarLeft]
See what I mean?[AN]
[Left]
Redemption is a lost cause[NL]
for a man like you, Barth.[AN]
Your reign as pirate king ends here![AN]

##Ch2_4_PreBattle_CelicaTalk
[MidLeft][LoadCelica]
I heard talk in port about a man seeking[NL]
revenge on Barth for killing his family.[AN]
Perhaps this is his crew?[.5] Let's advance[NL]
with caution and try to aid their cause.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm...?[.5] What's with the sudden[NL]
shift in position?[AN]
[FarRight]
Well, I'll be.[.5] Looks like another[NL]
band has joined the fray.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[.4] Must be our lucky day.[AN]
Splitting their forces in two should[NL]
make Barth that much easier to defeat.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You know why I like you, Valbar?[NL]
Because you're such an optimist.[AN]
From where I'm standing, our odds[NL]
look somewhere between grim and dire.[AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
What, you mean because we're horribly[NL]
outnumbered?[.5] I've fought worse.[AN]
And I'll fight ten times that,[NL]
as long as Valbar's by my side![AN]
[MidLeft]
You two better stop gabbing like hens and[NL]
start fighting like you want to live.[AN]
If we can take Barth out of the picture,[NL]
his goons should scatter...[AN]
So you know what to do, right, boys?[NL]
Ignore the runts and take aim for Barth![AN]

Just between us sailors, there's said[NL]
to be treasure at the Seabound Shrine.[AN]
Treasure so fantastic, there's a dragon[NL]
that guards it.[.5] A dead one.[AN]
If you had the Seraphim spell, you might[NL]
stand a chance against it...[AN]
Well, all I have to give is this sword.[NL]
No telling if it'll help.[.5] Good luck.[AN]

Are you here to take down that dastard,[NL]
Barth, as well?[.5] Well, that's some luck![AN]
We could use a hand out here.[NL]
He sure did bring his friends.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Shall we combine our forces?[AN]
[Right]
I like the sound of that.[NL]
Though--[.4][ToggleSmile]one condition, yeah?[AN]
Let me at least take a swing at that[NL]
slimy sea rat.[.5] It's personal.[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadLeon]
[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight]
Naturally, I'll be joining too.[NL]
Save a shot for me--[AN]
I want to make the dastard pay[NL]
for every life he's taken![AN]

that dastard Barth as well?[AN]
[CloseEyes]If only you'd arrived a moment[NL]
earlier, Leon would be...[AN]

emotional there for a second.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]So hey, is there anything[NL]
I can do to thank you?[AN]
