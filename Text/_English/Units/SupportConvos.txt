What's up, Alm?[NL]
You've been scowling for a while now.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, it's nothing.[NL]
Don't mind me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, it's clearly not [0x93]nothing.[0x94][AN]
You were staring at the nearby village[NL]

A-[.4]and what if I didn't[NL]

[MidRight]
Please. You ALWAYS want seconds.[NL]

Now, spit it out![NL]
What's bothering you so damn much?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm not bothered, I swear![AN]
I just never knew that the[NL]
outside world was so big.[AN]
It's nothing like[NL]
Grandpa said it was.[AN]
[MidRight]
Your old man was just[NL]
looking out for you.[AN]
Believe me, these roads[NL]
weren't always so peaceful.[AN]
Brigands used to prowl[NL]
these trails all the time[AN]
waiting for unsuspecting[NL]
travelers to pass by.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But now we're fighting[NL]
Zofian soldiers.[AN]
What happened to all the thugs[NL]
you're talking about?[AN]
[MidRight]
They've probably scattered and[NL]
holed themselves up in their hideouts,[AN]
if you ask me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you think that we're[NL]
responsible for that?[AN]

[MidRight]
Woah there, buddy! Relax.[AN]
Don't let all this[NL]

I wish I could relax, Gray.[AN]
The list of things I need[NL]
to remember is endless:[AN]

Who managed to save Faye when[NL]
she fell down the old well?[AN]
You! You're capable of more[NL]
than you think you are![AN]
[MidLeft]
It's not as simple as just helping[NL]
individual people with their problems.[AN]
There's a lot more to running an army[NL]

You... You would do that for me?[AN]
[MidRight]
Absolutely. We're friends after all.[NL]
And friends have to stick together.[AN]

Hey Alm, how's tricks?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hey Tobin. What's up?[AN]
[MidRight]
Between this battle and the last one,[NL]
it's been pretty uneventful, I suppose.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You sure about that, Tobin?[AN]
In our last battle,[NL]
the enemy surrounded you.[AN]
Gray had to come and save you.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
I had everything under control![AN]
I don't need you to sit here and[NL]
tell me how great Gray is[AN]
when I was doing fine enough[NL]
on my own, thank you![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry Tobin, I didn't[NL]
mean to offend you.[AN]
I was just concerned, that's all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, well, whatever.[AN]
Anyway, how's life in the[NL]
Deliverance been treating you?[AN]
Is it everything you'd[NL]
hoped it would be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's far from perfect, but being able[NL]
to go out and see Zofia for real,[AN]
and to serve its people while I'm at it,[NL]
more than makes up for that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Eh. To each his own I suppose.[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
I mean, I don't get how you can just[NL]
up and fight for this country on a whim,[AN]
not knowing whether you're going to get[NL]
anything in return or not.[AN]
Most soldiers only work as hard[NL]
as they do so that they can have[AN]
enough money to sustain themselves[NL]
and their families. I'm no different.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't really have anyone to[NL]
worry about aside from Grandfather.[AN]
[MidRight]
But you need to have something to[NL]
support yourself with, Alm![AN]
This war isn't gonna last forever,[NL]
and you aren't the type to just[AN]
curl up and die once it's done.[NL]
What're you gonna do after that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin, we aren't kids anymore.[AN]
Every day we risk our lives in combat,[NL]
and every day that we're not[AN]
slain on the battlefield is a[NL]
lucky day in my book.[AN]
We're soldiers now, and I'm more[NL]
worried about surviving tomorrow[AN]
than what I'm going to do[NL]
a few years from now.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm, that's not the point.[AN]
If we do make it through this war,[NL]
what then?[AN]

I've had way worse injuries from[NL]
wrangling Sir Mycen's hogs.[AN]
Nothing to worry about.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tobin, your arm is bleeding really bad.[AN]
You should go to the back and get it[NL]
patched up before it gets any worse.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alm, listen, I'm fine.[AN]
Go on back to the front lines.[NL]
I'm perfectly fine.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tobin, listen to me.[NL]
I know you don't want to admit it,[AN]
but it's obvious that you're in pain,[NL]
and I need you to acknowledge the fact[AN]
that if you don't get this treated,[NL]
you could die.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Would you just buzz off!?[NL]
I said I'm fine![AN]
[MidRight]
Tobin, what happens if I let you go[NL]
off with a grisly wound like that[AN]
and it gets you killed?[AN]
What do you expect me to do,[NL]
carry my best friend all the way home[AN]
to Ram Village in a box!?[AN]
And explain to his family that he died[NL]
a stupid death because he was too[AN]
proud to admit that he was injured!?[AN]
If you don't care about how I feel,[NL]
then for the sake of your parents,[AN]
please go and get patched up![AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, alright.[NL]
Good goblets, you're paranoid.[AN]
But out of respect for my folks,[NL]
I'll go to the back and get patched up.[AN]
But this isn't over, Alm.[NL]
Be ready, because we're going to duel,[AN]

For what you said to me when I was[NL]
holding you down so the cleric[AN]
could tend to your wounds, or[NL]
for what you said to me in our duel?[AN]
[MidRight]
Both.[NL]
The way I talked to you[AN]
and called you names[NL]
was inappropriate of me,[AN]
and I just wanted you to know that[NL]
I didn't mean anything by it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's alright, Tobin. Really.[NL]
I'm not Kliff.[AN]

No, it's not alright.[AN]
You've been nothing but concerned[NL]

I yelled at you and[NL]
gave you a hard time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin. Listen to me.[AN]
You made a mistake. You apologized.[NL]
Let it go and learn from it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm... I just want to impress you guys.[NL]
I want to impress my siblings.[AN]
When I come home from the war,[AN]
I don't want them to be hearing about[NL]
the exploits of Alm and his soldiers,[AN]
I want them to hear about the[NL]
exploits of Tobin![AN]
How he persevered, and... how[NL]
he did something worth talking about![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But Tobin, you've already done that![NL]
You joined the Deliverance to be able[AN]
to put food on the table for[NL]
your family back home.[AN]
Your efforts are going to put your[NL]
little brothers through school.[AN]
Even if you don't make a big name[NL]
for yourself, you'll always be[AN]
the hero that gave your[NL]
brothers an education.[AN]
And at the end of the day,[NL]
I feel like they'd care about that[AN]
a lot more than they'd care about what[NL]
me and Gray and everyone else has done.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah... Yeah! You're right![AN]

almost every woman in the village.[AN]
Didn't think I'd make it out alive[NL]

Is this because of what I said?[AN]

[Beat]Oh, posh. Fine. I admit it.[AN]
You said you liked my greetings, and I[N]

But Clair, I like you the way you are![AN]
You're proud, overbearing, and don't[N]

Please, let me learn[NL]

You can clearly protect yourself with[NL]

I know. But there might...[AN]
No, there will be a time[NL]

that magic alone will not save me then.[NL]
And if my friends are in danger too...[AN]

You're the most experienced person[NL]
I can turn to. So please...[AN]

Alright, lass. But don't come crying[NL]

Tighten your grip more.[NL]
Shift your weight to the center.[AN]

Oh... I see. I'm sorry[NL]
you lost contact with her.[AN]

It was my fault, anyway.[NL]
Shouldn't've took the bait.[AN]

Since I was small, all I've ever wanted[NL]

But my father insisted I wield a pen,[NL]
and barred me from the sword or lance.[AN]
I lost out on some of the best years[NL]

Sometimes I fear I'm only playing[NL]

You convinced me I was being a fool.[AN]
As a boy, I told myself the only books[NL]

I passed up countless valuable lessons[NL]
just to prove a point to my father.[AN]
Now I'm trying to serve as lieutenant[NL]

Every day is a painful reminder of[NL]
just how little I actually know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Nonsense.[NL]
[Beat]Though if it makes you feel better,[AN]
I have just as many regrets.[NL]
Every time I barely escape with my life[AN]
in battle, I curse myself for not[NL]
taking my early training more seriously.[AN]
But at least time is on our side. It's[NL]
never too late to learn, after all.[AN]

You're right--a warrior can be a scholar[NL]

you miss your lady.[AN]

Still, a shame you are not Alm. A visit[N]

Ouch. Tell me how you really feel.[N]
But then again, roses with thorns[AN]

Oh, my dear Gray. Let me[N]
attempt to lay it out for you.[AN]
First, what do you want from me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm madly in love with you![N]
Isn't that part obvious enough?[AN]
[MidRight]
You do not even know[N]
the meaning of the word.[AN]
You think you can walk up to a woman[N]

You truly expect her to swoon[N]
the moment you offer up your love?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, but[Beat] but[N]
I DO love you![AN]
[MidRight]
No. You do not. You WANT me.[N]
You intend to HAVE me.[AN]
But not at the expense of your pride.[AN]
You toss out kind words and I-love-yous[N]
without putting any weight behind them.[AN]
That way, if I refuse you, you can tell[N]
yourself it was all a jape in good fun.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's[Beat] not
how I feel at all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, poor you.[N]
And what of my feelings?[AN]
Do I not deserve better than[N]
these trite gambits of yours?[AN]
My heart belongs to the man who takes[N]

So do I just walk[N]

[MidRight]
I may have been[Beat] out of line.[AN]
I had only just found out[N]
how close Alm and Celica are,[AN]
and I[Beat] I was sorting[N]
through my emotions.[AN]
[MidLeft]
*sigh* So I'm next down the list?[AN]
[MidRight]
No. I merely wanted to apologize[N]
for taking out my frustrations on you.[AN]
I did not mean what I said--or at[N]
least not in the manner I said it.[AN]
Will you forgive me?[N]
Honestly, I enjoy these talks of ours.[AN]
And not just because of the[N]
sweet nothings you whisper.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]But because as clumsy as you are,[N]
I know you would never hurt a fly.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]You are a kind man, Gray. [Beat]And[N]

I'll cut to the chase:[NL]
your father was a merchant, yeah?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mhmm. And a pretty damn good one, too.[AN]
[MidRight]
And he gets to travel the world?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Uh-huh.[AN]
[MidRight]
Has he ever told you stories[NL]
about his travels?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Plenty.[AN]
From the extravagant cities[NL]
in the heart of Zofia,[AN]
to the vast chasms of Macedon.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You must be jealous of him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not really.[AN]
He's always being hassled by[NL]
brigands and rogues,[AN]
and escorts cost a fortune for[NL]
journeys outside of Valentia.[AN]
I don't see how he can[NL]
stand being a merchant.[AN]
As it stands, we only just[NL]
make ends meet from his profits.[AN]
We'd be better of just harvesting[NL]
livestock and crop like everyone else.[AN]
[MidRight]
So what? You're still in the[NL]
same spot as the rest of us.[AN]
If I could travel the world[NL]
and make enough to survive,[AN]
I'd be content.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course YOU would be content.[AN]
Roaming from who-knows-where to Pyrathi[NL]
seems right up your alley.[AN]

What's that supposed to mean, Gray?[AN]

Oh, please.[AN]
Everyone knows you and your mother don't[NL]
exactly have the best relationship.[AN]
I would bet tonight's helpings that you[NL]
didn't even tell her you were leaving.[AN]
[MidRight]
And how is any of that your business?[AN]
What does my relationship with my[NL]
mother have to do with this?[AN]

Because if I had to choose between[NL]
seeing the grandiose stories of yore[AN]
and otherworldly knick-knacks,[AN]

Hear me out, buddy. Please.[AN]

Never call me Kliffie-pie again.[NL]
You know how much it annoys me.[AN]

Alright, sheesh. Anyway, look...[NL]
Sorry for what I said earlier, alright?[AN]
I forgot that you and your mother's[NL]
relationship was a sore spot for you,[AN]
and it was rude of me to bring that up.[AN]
I was just angry that you didn't[NL]
consider how I felt about[AN]
my father's globe-trotting.[AN]
You always romanticize the idea of[NL]
seeing the world--meanwhile,[AN]
every night I worry I'll wake up to[NL]
a messenger telling me that my pa[AN]
met the bad end of some brute's axe.[AN]
I appreciate the stories and souvenirs,[NL]
but I worry for him.[AN]
I wish he would've been here when[NL]
I told Ma I'd joined the Deliverance.[AN]
He'd be proud of me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It's okay, Gray.[NL]
It was ill-mannered of me not to[AN]

matters in your life.[AN]
I wish I could've met my father.[NL]
Who knows how much better off Mother[AN]
would have been if he hadn't abandoned[NL]
us before I was born.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kliff... I'm sorry.[AN]
I forget that your mom wasn't[NL]
always like that.[AN]
Back when Celica was still around,[AN]
she was always doting on[NL]
her perfect genius son.[AN]
Which, by the way, meant that me and[NL]
Tobe were "those dirty village boys"[AN]
she'd gripe about to Sir Mycen...[AN]

Don't worry about me.[AN]
You have your own problems.[NL]

Hey Kliff. How's tricks?[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you have a moment?[AN]
[MidLeft]
All the time in the world,[AN]
give or take the battle[NL]
we're in right now.[AN]
What's on your mind?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's it like outside of Valentia?[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
You said your father told you[NL]
stories of his travels.[AN]
I want you to tell me[NL]
what Archanea's like.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I'll bite.[NL]
Whaddya wanna know?[AN]
[MidRight]
What do you know about Khadein?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ooh, that's a fancy one to start with![AN]
Khadein is a beautiful city hidden[NL]
deep in the heart of an unholy desert.[AN]
It's home to the greatest[NL]
magic school on the continent,[AN]
so they're always in need of[NL]
potion ingredients and such.[AN]
Many merchants steer clear of it,[NL]
given how treacherous the journey is,[AN]
but my pa's gone down[NL]
that road many times.[AN]
[MidRight]
So your father's been there...[AN]
Has he ever crossed paths with[NL]
a man about his age,[AN]
with white hair, and one finger[NL]
missing from his left hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not that I know of. How come?[AN]
[MidRight]
Because my father was a mage.[AN]
Mother told me he vanished one day[NL]
when she began to show,[AN]
leaving nothing else but[NL]
his medal of graduation[AN]
from Khadein's academy.[AN]
He left in search of greater knowledge,[NL]
walking the path of a nomad.[AN]
No woman or child could tie him down.[AN]
And I feel like that's why my mother[NL]
is the way she is now.[AN]
She doesn't want me to leave her[NL]
like her lover did long ago.[AN]
She hates me because I remind her[NL]
so much of the man she loved.[AN]
And she's not wrong.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] That's... Wow.[NL]
That sucks.[AN]
[MidRight]
I want to travel the world.[AN]
Not just to escape from the pigsty[NL]
that I was raised in,[AN]
but in hopes that some day,[NL]
I will find my father.[AN]
I want to meet the man I take after,[NL]
and tell him how much I hate him.[AN]
Tell him how much suffering he's[NL]
put upon me and my mother both.[AN]
I might even burn him[NL]
to ash with my magic.[AN]
Someone like him doesn't deserve[NL]
my kindness or my forgiveness.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Kliff... Have you ever considered that[NL]
maybe he was doing it to protect you?[AN]
[MidRight]
To protect us?[NL]
From what?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I dunno, maybe he had a[NL]
bounty on his head?[AN]
[MidRight]
Nope.[NL]
He was a talented mage,[AN]
but he was no one special,[NL]
and I hate him for it.[AN]
And even worse, I hate that I'm[NL]
going to end up the same way.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
As in knocking a maiden up[NL]
and then abandoning her[AN]
in hopes of acquiring more[NL]
knowledge of the world?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
No. I want to leave Ram behind[NL]
once this war is over.[AN]
My mother won't let me,[NL]
and will beg me,[AN]
even try and force me,[NL]
to stay, but I won't.[AN]
I'm going to leave her because I've[NL]
had enough of manure and barn animals,[AN]
and I'm going to travel far and wide.[NL]
In that regard, I take after my father.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's just you.[NL]
She can't blame you for growing up![AN]
[MidRight]
I know. I've told her the same thing[NL]
countless times.[AN]
In the end, I always end up with a[NL]
bump on my head, and then she[AN]
has to buy a new broom the next day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then don't hate yourself[NL]
for pursuing your dream.[AN]
You can't let your ma[NL]
hold you back forever.[AN][ToggleSmile]
If you want to travel the world,[AN]
you've got one of the best friends in it[NL]
on your side.[AN]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm sorry for being so rude to you.[NL]
What you said made me think.[AN]
I don't want to spend the rest of[NL]

my ways, starting with you.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
That's wonderful![AN]
I'm glad that the Mother has enabled me[NL]
to help you overcome your problems.[AN]
What did you have in mind?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
In all honesty, I don't think I can[NL]
make a complete change overnight.[AN]
It would probably take years to undo[NL]
the amount of emotional barriers and[AN]
defense mechanisms I've[NL]
set up for myself.[AN]
I can't guarantee that I'll be able[NL]
to change at all, for that matter,[AN]
but I want to try.[AN]
I want to start being more up-front[NL]
with people about things.[AN]
Trying to put myself out there more,[AN]
regardless of what annoying remarks[AN]
others have to say to me.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
If you're not sure, you can always[NL]
try and practice with me.[AN]
I'm always open to conversation.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you think we could start now?[AN]
[MidRight]
Certainly.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The other day you asked me[NL]
about my father, correct?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes.[NL]
Both of us grew up without fathers,[AN]
so I figured it would be a[NL]
good place to start.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't know much about my father.[AN]
But one of the things I do know is[NL]
that he's left me with this.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold on... That insignia![NL]
That's the magic academy of Khadein![AN]
[MidLeft]
Indeed. It's a medal of graduation.[NL]
He left this with my mother.[AN]
[MidRight]
My father, too, was a graduate[NL]
of Khadein's academy.[AN]
Mother also told me he was,[NL]
quite distinctly,[AN]
missing one finger[NL]
on his left hand.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wait[Beat] then that would mean[Beat][NL]
that we share the same father.[AN]

It appears so.[AN]
Although our mothers are different,[NL]
we are blood all the same.[AN]

exciting after all...[AN]

[MidRight]
...Well, you know.[.5] Things you wouldn't[NL]

My only friends are the village boys.[AN]
So, I don't know what I'd talk about[NL]

Excuse me, sir--[NL]

I just wanted to check[NL]
if you were well.[AN]
Magic takes a toll[NL]
on the body,[AN]

pushing yourself too much.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Magic--Oh. You were[NL]
talking to...[....] me?[AN]
[MidRight]
Er--yes, I was.[NL]
...Would you rather I didn't?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That wasn't what I meant.[NL]
I intended to communicate that, er...[AN]
that doesn't happen very often.[NL]
I was merely caught off guard.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see...[NL]
Luthier, I've noticed you don't[AN]
ask for help even when you've[NL]
exhausted your magic reserves.[AN]
So I wanted to be proactive and[NL]
see how you're doing.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's not necessary.[NL]
I know my limits.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'm sure you do, but I would[NL]
prefer that no one in our group[AN]
neglects their health. So please[NL]
let me know if you're feeling weary.[AN]

## SilqueLuthier_B

[MidRight][LoadLuthier]
[MidRight]
I require your assistance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh--hello, Luthier.[NL]
How are you feeling?[AN]
Should I heal your wounds?[AN]
[MidRight]
No, there's no need for that.[NL]
Well--maybe as a demonstration.[AN]
You see, you've mastered a type[NL]
of magic I do not yet have command of.[AN]
Teach me your ways.[.4] I must study it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Um, well, I'm not sure how much[NL]
I can teach...[AN]
White magic comes from faith and piety.[AN]
I could help lead you in prayer[NL]
sometime, but faith itself[AN]
isn't something I can teach.[AN]
[MidRight]
Obviously.[NL]
Magical ability comes from the blood.[AN]
But magical applications[NL]
come from intense study.[AN]
There must be some holy text or[NL]
ritual you perform to maintain[AN]
your communion with the spirits.[AN]
In this case, I should say,[NL]
with Mila herself.[AN] 
I presume she is the source of[NL]
healing magic, as described in[AN]
the Zofian Grimoire, page 47,[NL]
paragraph 2.[AN][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
[0x93]The Mother giveth to the land[NL]
the power of life,[AN]
and to the plants which grow in--[0x94][AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft]
--Er, yes, I've read that.[NL]
It's just as you said,[AN]
prayer to Mila reinforces[NL]
your bond of faith, and--[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah, so you've read it too![AN]
I've been searching for someone[NL]
to discuss its merits with.[AN]
So few seem to have[NL]
truly studied the text.[AN]
I'm currently on my[NL]
one hundred and fifth re-read.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's very dedicated of y--[AN]
[MidRight]
--What did you think of the author's[NL]
description of the transfer of[AN]
life-force between caster and spirit?[NL]
I visualize it each time I cast.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Er, well, truthfully, I've only[NL]
skimmed it...[AN]
I know little of magic[NL]
beyond the church's teachings.[AN]
I preferred to learn through[NL]
practical applications--[AN]
healing the sick, meeting others[NL]
on pilgrimages...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You really must finish reading it.[NL]
I insist--it's life-changing.[AN]
It's my gift to you in knowledge[AN]
so that perhaps you will share[NL]
your knowledge with me.[AN]
I hope this can be the start of[NL]
a regular discusson on magical[AN]
study techniques.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...All right, Luthier.[NL]
Let's make a deal.[AN]
I'll read the whole book[AN]
if you can promise me[NL]
you'll put your health first.[AN]
Promise me that you'll come visit[NL]
me at the first sign of weariness.[AN]
--And don't stay up[NL]
all night reading.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Mm... I'm afraid that will be[NL]
tough to commit to.[AN]
But if that's what is needed[NL]
to advance my knowledge[AN]
of white magic,[NL]
then you have my word.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadSilque]

I thought seriously about[NL]
what you said,[AN]
and I've found it to be empirically[NL]
true that studying with others[AN]
leads to a greater rate of[NL]
information absorption.[AN]
You mentioned going out and meeting[NL]
others on pilgrimages.[AN]
...Perhaps that's[NL]
what I've been missing.[AN]
[MidRight]
...You seem to keep[NL]
to yourself quite a lot.[AN]
I think it would do your soul[NL]
some good to travel,[AN]
and to speak with others more often.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I find that prospect frankly...[NL]
terrifying.[AN]
People don't often like[NL]
to talk with me, you see.[AN] 
In fact, I[Beat][NL]
really don't have any friends.[AN]
[MidRight]
...[.5]You don't?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well--I do, but[Beat][NL]
I suppose cats don't count...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, you love cats too?[AN]
We used to keep some in the priory's[NL]
granary to help with the mice.[AN]
I'd always visit them[NL]
after evening prayers.[AN]
It seems they only liked me when[NL]
I brought them fish, though.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah, that's a common misconception.[NL]
You may think them aloof creatures,[AN]
but when they turn and sit quietly[NL]
with their backs to you,[AN]
it's actually a sign of affection,[NL]
as the cat feels comfortable[AN]
enough to not have to keep watch[NL]
over y--[AN]
[MidRight]
--You know, Luthier, when you talk[NL]
about something you love,[AN]
your whole face lights up.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Oh.[AN]
If I'm boring you,[NL]
please say so.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, no, that's not a bad thing.[NL]
It's a sign of dedication and passion.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][NL]
[Beat][AN]
That's[Beat] the nicest thing[NL]
anyone has ever said to me.[AN]
[MidRight]
All I ask is that you take[NL]
better care of yourself[AN]
so you can pursue those passions.[AN]
Put the candle out before[NL]
the rooster crows.[AN]
Get out and talk more with others[NL]
who love the same things you do.[AN]
I'm sure you'll find more friendly[NL]
ears than you thought you would.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...[....][ToggleSmile]All right, I've decided.[NL]
I will venture forth and find a[AN]
commune of mages with whom I can[NL]
discuss my studies.[AN]
...Since you're the one who[NL]
inspired this idea,[AN]
I'd like to extend the invitation[NL]
to you as well.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Well, after the war ends...[AN]
It was my hope to give aid[NL] 
to the people of Zofia[AN]
as they rebuild and recover.[AN] 
But someday... I would like[NL]
to travel again.[AN]
Don't delay your dreams[NL]
just for my sake,[AN]
but when you return to Valentia,[NL] 
perhaps I'll depart with you then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Splendid. [ToggleSmile]Er, but while I appreciate[NL]
your enthusiasm, I have a small request:[AN]
Please DO NOT run headlong into[NL]
the enemy's ranks again.[AN]
How many times now have we had to[NL]
save you because you got separated?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Eeep![NL]
Yes, sir. S-sorry, sir.[AN]
I will strive to do better, sir![NL]
And if I fail to learn my lesson,[AN]
then I am prepared to die a[NL]
warrior's death for my mistakes![AN]
[MidLeft]
Let us hope it does not come to that.[AN]
You know, you have tremendous talent,[NL]
Forsyth, but you are far too tense.[AN]
Perhaps you should attempt to...[NL]
loosen up.[AN]
[MidRight]
L-loosen up, sir? [MoveMidRight]A-all right, sir![NL]
I'll work on that right away![AN]
Just watch how loose I can be![AN][ToggleSmile]
In the name of Zofia, you'll never see[NL]
another soldier so limber as I![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

Ah, Forsyth.[NL]
You're in fine form today.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Sir Clive! Not half as fine a[NL]
form as you, sir! Never fear--[AN]
I intend to slay as many foes as[NL]
possible in your good name![AN]
Long live the Deliverance, and[NL]
three huzzahs for Sir Clive![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Uh, yes. Very good.[NL][CloseEyes]
Listen, Forsyth...[AN][OpenEyes]
I couldn't help but eavesdrop when[NL]
you and Python were talking.[AN]
You do know that you can speak to me[NL]
the same as you do to him, yes?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Forgive me, sir, but I'm not certain[NL]
that I grasp your meaning.[AN]
[MidRight]
With Python, you open up and[NL]
speak your mind.[AN]
You're friendly. Relaxed.[AN]
That's what I meant when I[NL]
said you can loosen up.[AN]
Just treat me the same[NL]
as you would a friend.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
EXACTLY the same, sir?[.5] Uhhh[Beat][NL]
True, I grew up with Python, but...[AN]
well, you're the furthest thing[NL]
from him I could imagine![AN]
Wisdom pours from your mouth,[AN]
where only filth pours from his![AN]
[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
Uh...[.5] right.[NL][OpenEyes]
Perhaps I should be more direct...[AN]
There's no need to flatter me at[NL]
every turn, Forsyth.[AN]
You've well proven your ability and[NL]
worthiness for your rank as Lieutenant.[AN]
You needn't put me on a pedestal[NL]
for fear of losing that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
O-Oh...[NL]
Do I seem insincere?[AN]
It's hardly flattery if it's[NL]
truly how I feel.[AN]
Lieutenant or no, you're still[NL]
the man I admire most.[AN]
Forgive my coarse language,[NL]
but it would practically be blasphemous[AN]
for me to treat you the same as[NL]
a knucklehead like Python.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]
Well, give my words[NL]
some thought, Lieutenant.[AN]
We're closer in rank now[NL]
than you think,[AN]
and it's my hope that we can work[NL]
together as friends and equals.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Truly? [MoveMidLeft]What an honor, sir![AN]
Then, I shall find a way[NL]
to see it through![AN]

Sir Clive?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Forsyth, what's wrong?[NL]
You look distressed.[AN]
What happened to your usual[NL]
vim and vigor?[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry, sir.[NL]
I tried to do as you said.[AN]
And I mean, I tried EVERYTHING.[NL]
But I just can't seem to make it work.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What are you talking about?[AN]
[MidRight]
You know. Being[Beat]loose.[AN]
You asked me to treat you the same[NL]
way as I do Python, remember?[AN]
But the only way I could do it was[NL]
to treat Python with MORE respect.[AN]
And the filthy things that man says![NL]
...We ended up coming to blows.[AN]
Lukas had to come and pull us apart.[NL]
How can I ever treat him like you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] think you may have approached[NL]
the problem the wrong way.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Sir Clive, why can't things just[NL]
stay the way they are?[AN][OpenEyes]
You're the land's finest knight--[AN]
strong, handsome, virtuous, a symbol[NL]
of everything I've ever admired.[AN]
And I know this is strange considering[NL]
how long we've fought together,[AN]
but I still get excited every time I[NL]
have a chance to speak with you.[AN]
If I seem tense or get carried away,[NL]
it's probably because of that.[AN]
[Beat]Do you know what I mean?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah! Now we're getting somewhere.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Er... we are?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're finally starting to open up![NL]
Just don't overthink it, all right.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Also, I assure you that I'm not worthy[NL]
of such levels of admiration.[AN]
You've seen all the terrible[NL]
mistakes I've made.[AN]
I feel guilty being put[NL]
on anyone's pedestal.[AN]
[MidRight]
Nonsense, sir![AN]
True, losing Zofia Castle was a blow,[NL]
and we've seen our share of failures.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But I've watched you closely.[AN]
Every time, you picked yourself up,[NL]
dusted yourself off, and kept going.[AN]
You're the reason we still have hope![AN]
I WANT to put you on my pedestal![NL]
I want you pedestaled![AN]
Because it's my faith in you that gives[NL]
me the courage to fight without fear.[AN]
I know Alm may be our leader now...[NL]
but you're still the banner we look to.[AN]
You should remember that, sir.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I shall.[NL]
Thank you, Forsyth.[AN]
And forgive me for asking you to[NL]
change who you are.[AN]
I realize now that you're already the[NL]
sort of man the Deliverance needs.[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-you mean it, sir?[NL][MoveMidRight]
Oh, thank you! You honor me![AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ahh![.4] Yes?![NL]
[Beat]Um...[.4] yes?[AN]

Why the surprise? I just wanted to[NL]

[MidRight]
Oh.[.4] Well, I suppose I've had[NL]
better days. [Beat]Uh, sir.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Honesty always was your finest trait.[AN][OpenEyes]
Still, now that Alm has assumed[NL]
leadership, we've many new recruits.[AN]
They're inexperienced, and even[NL]
frightened in many cases.[AN]
Such men look to you, and it would[NL]
behoove you to set a better example.[AN]
[MidRight]
Beggin' your pardon, but I ain't[NL]
so sure that's a good idea.[AN]
Folks already got you and Forsyth and[NL]
Lukas for role models if they want 'em.[AN][ToggleSmile]
If ol' Python starts acting[NL]
all hoity-toity, they'll have[AN]
no one approachable left.[AN] 
Someone around here has to[NL] 
stay on their level.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I understand, but this is an army.[NL]
We must also teach them discipline.[AN]
[MidRight]
You won't get discipline if you[NL]
don't create a welcoming atmosphere.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And you don't think we have that now?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I didn't say THAT. [Beat]Er, sir.[NL]
But truth is, it's not always[AN]
easy for everyone to find[NL]
his or her place here.[AN]

## ClivePython_B
[MidLeft][LoadPython]
[MidRight][LoadClive]
Ah, Python.[.4] I'm glad I found you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Something wrong?[AN]
[MidRight]
I must confess, our last discussion[NL]
has been weighing on me quite heavily.[AN]
I seek to close the rift between the[NL]
Deliverance's nobles and commomers.[AN]
But there are days when it seems[NL]
to only grow wider.[AN]
Have I not endeavored to treat those[NL]
of low birth fairly?[AN]
I always thought to reward my men based[NL]
on merit, not station.[AN]
And yet you believe that some[NL]
still struggle to fit in.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you won't win any points by[NL]
using terms like [0x93]low birth". [Beat]Sir.[AN]
You make it sound like it's our[NL]
privilege to be elevated to your level.[AN]
Like if we don't have your station,[NL]
then all we really have are our merits.[AN]
[MidRight]
I never meant to slight you,[NL]
Python. Nor anyone else.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, I know that. And anyway, you[NL]
didn't create the order of the world.[AN]
It ain't your fault.[AN]
But respectfully and all?[.4] You might[NL]
wanna stop preaching understanding.[AN]
You can't understand us.[.4] Not really.[NL]
Your life is just very [Beat]different.[AN]
[MidRight]
You're right. I've never had to worry[NL]
about starving or freezing to death.[AN]
I have never had to face the same[NL]
indignities or despair as you.[AN]
Yet in trying to champion those causes,[NL]
perhaps I have become a hypocrite.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Eh, don't flog yourself about it.[AN]
Lots of commoners want[NL]
a champion like you.[AN]
Hell, Forsyth practically walks[NL]
behind you tossin' out rose petals.[AN]
But some of us commonfolk just aren't[NL]
ever going to relate to you, so...[AN]
[Beat]You know what?[.4] What do I know.[NL]
Forget I said anything, sir.[AN][ClearFace]

## ClivePython_A
[MidRight][LoadPython]
[MidLeft][LoadClive]
Python.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sir Clive. Your spirits lifted yet?[NL]
Sorry for running my mouth, by the way.[AN]
After our last heart-to-heart, everyone[NL]
blamed me for putting you out of sorts.[AN]
Clair practically had me at lancepoint.[NL]
...Wait, not practically. Literally.[AN]
Anyway, if you could tell 'em to let up[NL]
on poor Python, I'd appreciate it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I apologize for what you went through.[NL][CloseEyes]
...Especially that lance business.[AN][OpenEyes]
It took me some time to come to grips[NL]
with all you told me.[AN]
Would you hear me out?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]All right.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Python, I believe in structure.[AN]
There should be a king and a nobility,[NL]
and beneath them, common people.[AN]
That is the structure I was born into.[AN]
To be blunt, I still believe it is the[NL]
structure a kingdom needs to survive.[AN]
So, I apologize if that does not[NL]
sit well with you.[AN]
[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.5]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidLeft]
But I CAN believe all that and still[NL]
have tremendous respect for you.[AN]
I mean what I say, Python:[AN]
Noble or common, any man who fights[NL]
at my side is my ally and friend.[AN]
I just wanted you to know that.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
...I really got your silk stockings[NL]
in a bunch, didn't I?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Well, so long as we're leveling with[NL]
each other, I think you're dead wrong.[AN]
Nobles living fancy while the people[NL]
starve ain't structure--[.4]it's privilege.[AN]
And I hate any man who looks down on me[NL]
because of it.[AN]
Now, does that mean I hate you?[.4] No.[AN]
You may not be my FAVORITE person[NL]
in all the land, but--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Clearly not.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh. Touch[0xE9].[.4] Well, let's just agree[NL]
to disagree on this point, eh?[AN]
You may not know what it is[NL]
to starve or freeze,[AN]
but you still put your life and[NL]
livelihood at risk for others' sake.[AN]
That's enough to win my respect.[AN]
I mean, it's sure as hell something[NL]
you'll never catch ME doing![AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
So even if you don't have[NL]
my undying affection,[AN]
rest assured you have my bow,[NL]
at least until this mess is over.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
This gladens me, Python. Thank you.[AN]
I cannot say what waits for us at[NL]
the end of all this,[AN]
but I hope that we will secure better[NL]
lives for noble and commoner alike.[AN]
So please keep fighting--[NL]
if not for me, then for Alm.[AN]

Ugh. I said I would already, didn't I?[NL][ToggleSmile]

How goes it, old friend?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Pretty good, Leon.[NL]
How about you?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, you know me--[AN]
I'm always at 110 percent[NL]
when you're around.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha ha! I'm counting on it.[AN]
Still, truth be told, I've been[NL]
thinking about something...[AN]
You're a rather handsome devil,[NL]
and more than good in a fight.[AN]
If you could just keep your mouth shut,[NL]
I bet the ladies would flock to you![AN]
[MidRight]
Flattery will get you everywhere,[NL]
but...[.5] seriously?[ToggleSmile][AN][HalfCloseEyes]
What in Mila's name would I want[NL]
with a whole flock of women?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Isn't that what most[NL]
guys your age dream of?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh.[.5] Oh, honey, no.[.4] Not all of us.[AN][OpenEyes]
Listen, some guys in the military[NL]
are just...[.5] you know.[AN]
Making do with what they've got.[AN]
And as soon as they're on furlough,[AN]
they go right back to chasing women[NL]
like nothing ever happened.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, I knew that.[AN]
Not that it's any[NL]
of my business, but...[AN]
[MidRight]
Me, I'm not about playing games[NL]
or pretending.[AN][ToggleSmile]
On the field or on leave,[NL]
I am one hundred percent [0x93]me[0x94].[AN]

are beautiful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh.[.4] Yeah, okay, I get it.[NL]
My point still stands, though--[AN]
if you'd shut your yap more often,[NL]
I bet the men would flock to you![AN]

Hee hee.[AN]
It's a pretty thought, but fighting[NL]
at your side is enough for me--[AN]
I require no other distractions.[AN]

A question for you, old friend.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Shoot.[AN]
[MidRight]
You and me are past tiptoeing[NL]

You lost your whole family, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, I guess I did.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
And yet you still fight for this world.[NL]
That's quite impressive.[AN]
Of course, you owe the priestess girl,[NL]
but most men would give up regardless.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, maybe so.[AN]
I'll admit, there are times when[NL]
the pain's so bad it leaves me numb.[AN]
But that's because I was so damn[NL]
happy when I was with 'em.[AN]
It's all an even balance, you know?[NL]
I got good enough for all the bad.[AN]
Anyway, I avenged them, so there's[NL]
no point in hanging on to hate.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm impressed, Valbar.[ToggleSmile] ...I wish I[NL]
had that same kind of strength.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What d'you mean?[AN]
All things considered, you[NL]
tend to take things in stride.[AN]
[MidRight]
I know I make it look easy, but...[AN][CloseEyes]
When I think about what happened[NL]
to Andrei, I still feel vengeful.[AN][OpenEyes]
Like there's a cold little needle[NL]
of hate stuck in my heart.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm. You were a right mess[NL]
after that battle.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, it was years ago.[AN]
And of course, he and I didn't[NL]
have any children.[AN]
Compared to what you've gone through...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Now hold on, what's that got[NL]
to do with anything?[AN]
Losing people you love is painful,[AN]
but it's not a contest[NL]
whether it's one or a hundred.[AN]
We've all got our own ways[NL]
of dealing with it.[AN]
[MidRight]
I know, but I mean...[AN]
You can always fall in love again,[NL]
but you can never replace a child.[AN]
...And even when you do fall in love[NL]
again, how do you shake that guilt?[AN]
[MidLeft]

What I said about[NL]
falling in love again,[AN]

the partner who passed away...[AN]
Well, I wasn't just posing[NL]
a hypothetical there.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]

[Beat]Oh.[.5] Uh...[AN]

I said I'm not about playing games[NL]

So now the cat's out of[NL]

But, I know you're still grieving,[NL]
and maybe I'm still grieving too,[AN]
and I didn't want to ruin our[NL]
friendship, and you probably[AN]
don't even swing that way[NL]
in the first place.[AN]
...Hence the guilt.[AN]

...Well, you're wrong about[NL]
ONE of those things.[AN][ToggleSmile]
It's not gonna ruin our friendship,[NL]

Sure do.[AN]
Even if I can't be the[NL]
partner you were hoping for,[AN]
I've got no idea what I'd do with[NL]
my life now without you in it.[AN]
It's you 'n me against the world,[NL]
bud, like it's always been.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh heh.[.4] Glad to hear it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Whew![AN]
I was worried I'd break your heart[NL]
turning you down like that.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's fine.[AN]
Emotions come in many forms,[NL]
and as you say,[AN]
there's no point in hanging on.[AN]
I'm still glad I have these feelings,[NL]
and nothing will change that.[AN]

[MidRight]
I don't owe you[NL]
that information.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hear me out.[AN]
The squadron you once led[NL]
was stationed at my hometown[AN]
not long after you doffed[NL]
the mantle of knighthood.[AN]
While they were on patrol,[NL]
Barth and his pirates caught them[AN]
and launched a raid on my village.[AN]
My wife and children were slaughtered.[AN]
[Beat]If you'd been there, you could[NL]
have taken them on single-handedly[AN]

adding insult to injury.[AN]
But you at least deserve[NL]

no blame left to put on you.[AN]
I guess I'm sorry for bringing up[NL]

So, then... what are you[NL]

All my life I've been told revenge[NL]
only leaves you empty and wanting.[AN]
Am I really a good person if[NL]
crushing a pirate's skull[AN]
makes me feel this way?[AN]

I'm not the judge of that.[AN]
I'm just a swordsman;[NL]
my job is to cut things down.[AN]
How it makes me feel is irrelevant.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Maybe so. But I like to think[NL]
it at least brings peace[AN]

making it feel good,[AN]

And, to be frank--[AN]
it feels like that's happening[NL]
all over again.[AN]
Me finding some wonderful guy that[NL]

[0x93]she's PROBABLY not that into you.[0x94][AN]
Didn't I teach you that[NL]
with the wallet thing?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah--[.4]but this is different.[NL]
I know it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Sure, let me give you the[NL]
benefit of the doubt.[AN]
Listen, whether she wants you gone[NL]
or she's just trying to work through[AN]
her own feelings, the best thing[NL]
you can give her is time and space.[AN]
Man or woman, we all speak[NL]
the same language.[AN]
There's no secret code where [0x93]leave me[NL]
alone[0x94] means [0x93]please bother me.[0x94][AN]
She'll appreciate you actually,[NL]
y'know, listening to her.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Man, when you put it like that,[NL]
I feel like an idiot.[AN]
It's really that simple?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, not entirely,[NL]
but it's a good start.[AN]
Try it and see.[NL]
What's the worst that could happen?[AN]

Blurgh...[AN]
Feels like somebody's teaching[NL]
carpentry classes with my skull.[AN]
I guess ol' Python hit the bottle[NL]
too hard last night.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadAcantha][ToggleSmile]
Heh. A couple ales too much[NL]
for you, old man?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]
?![.4] When'd you get here?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You better focus those eyes of yours[NL]
if you plan to use that bow today![AN]
I've been standing here[NL]
the entire time.[AN]
[MidRight]
Crivens, at least wait 'til I've had[NL]
some caffeine before you--[AN]
Hey, wait a minute.[NL]
Isn't that my dagger?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh, this little thing?[NL]
What about it?[AN]
[ToggleSmile][MidRight]
When'd you get your mitts on my dagger?[NL]
It's got my inscription on it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Guess you blacked out, huh?[AN]
You bet your dagger for the whole[NL]
tavern's drinks in a gamble[AN]
with yours truly.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You can probably guess what happened.[AN]
[ToggleSmile][MidRight][HalfCloseEyes]
[Beat]I am gonna have to have a[NL]
LONG talk with Drunk Me.[AN][OpenEyes]
Now, what'll it take to get it back?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[0x93]Get it back?[0x94][.5] I dunno...[AN]
I think this'll go nicely[NL]
in my collection.[AN]
[MidRight]
How 'bout another bet, then?[NL]
Since you're SO good at gambling.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Dice again, I assume?[NL]
How do you feel about doubles?[AN]
On the condition that every time[NL]
you lose, that's another drink for me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Adding spice into the mix, eh?[NL]
Fine then--you've got yourself a deal.[AN]

You've lost again.[NL]
That's another drink on you.[AN]
[ToggleSmile][MidRight]
Hoo... Looks like I won't be[NL]
getting my dagger today.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What's with the dagger obsession?[AN]
Most people would give up and[NL]
get a new one right about now.[AN]
[MidRight]
They don't pay me nearly[NL]
enough for that.[AN]
Besides, I LIKE that one.[NL]
It's got a cool snake on it.[AN]
Blew my first month's[NL]
pay on it, even.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Are you admitting that you're poor?[NL]
How embarrassing.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Compared to when I was[NL]
begging on the streets,[AN]
I'm downright pampered,[NL]
thank you very much.[AN]
At least I came by it honestly.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oof, didn't mean to hit a nerve.[NL]
I can respect the hustle.[AN]
How about one more go?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well, I've sunk this much[NL]
time into it. Might as well.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It might help if you don't[NL]
bet snake eyes on this one[AN]
like you did every other time.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's my life and I'll make whatever[NL]
bet I want.[.5] Snake eyes.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Well! Fair 'n square, as promised.[NL]
Your dagger, sir.[AN]
[MidRight]
Whether it's one roll or eighty-one,[NL]
it always comes up Python eventually.[AN]
Never had that long of a[NL]
dry streak before, though.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Lady Luck works[NL]
in mysterious ways.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Or, she rigs her die.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat] you got me.[AN]
I only use those for playing against[NL]
people who can afford to lose.[AN]
Once I heard that you'd earned[NL]
your place in the army[AN]
instead of riding your family name,[NL]
I switched over to the straight die.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
So, you've got tricks up your sleeve.[AN]
Explains how you manage to keep leaving[NL]
the tavern with your pockets loaded.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What can I say?[NL]
A face like mine opens men's purses.[AN]
It's a wonder what a flutter[NL]
of the eyelashes[AN]
and a [0x93]wow, that's crazy![0x94] can do.[AN]
The poor saps are too proud to admit[NL]
they're just being played.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh.[.4] Your acting's terrible.[AN]
I could tell from a mile away that[NL]
men are the last thing on your mind.[AN]
So if y'ask me, they're just[NL]
getting what they deserve.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Bingo.[.4] Might as well use my looks[NL]
while I've still got 'em.[AN]
But someday I'll get hitched with a[NL]
lady as pretty as I am and[AN]
retire with my [0x93]honest[0x94] earnings.[AN]
[MidRight]
Pfft.[AN]
Well, while we're still[NL]
young and stupid,[AN]
care to join me for dinner[NL]
in the tavern?[AN]
I still need to pay off[NL]
those pints I owe you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hah![.4] You're going to regret[NL]
that offer, big time.[AN]

Don't I know it.[NL]
But that's half the fun.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Hey! Who're you callin' a "baby?"[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Relax, kid. It wasn't a jab at you.[AN]
But it's really uncanny; you look[NL]
exactly like your older brother.[AN]
[MidRight]
I do? Well, Ma always said[NL]
that we took after Pa.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, I wouldn't be surprised.[NL]
You certainly fight like Atlas too.[AN]
[MidRight]
He trained me for a bit before leaving[NL]
the village to go fight in the war.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I thought I was good at what he taught[NL]
me, but I still wasn't strong enough[AN]
to protect my little brothers[NL]
when Grieth's guys came.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hey now, don't look so down.[AN]
Trust me, those pirates play dirty.[NL]
Even I was cornered by those bastards,[AN]
but the priestess girl managed to[NL]
save me in the nick of time.[AN]
[MidRight]
It still doesn't feel good[NL]
losing to them...[AN]
I wish I was faster and stronger.[AN]
I would've been able to[NL]
take them down if I was.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, I'm not sure about the[NL]
faster part, but I can[AN]
tell you what I know about[NL]
taking a few hits.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
You'd really do that for me?![AN]
[MidLeft]
For a price, of course.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ulp! Well... I don't exactly[NL]
have much cash, but, uh...[AN][ToggleSmile]
D'you like dumplings?[NL]
I make some mean dumplings.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We take those.[AN]
[MidRight]
Great! I'll do it.[NL]
When do we start?[AN]

Easy there, Hyas. We'll start at the first watch tonight. Sound good?

Kamui! The training's[NL]
paying off, big time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, I'd say. You're learning[NL]
faster than I can keep up.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er... This might sound dumb[NL]
and out of the blue, but...[AN]
how'd you come up with these moves?[AN]
[MidLeft] 
Well, I wasn't always a mercenary.[AN]
I used to make an honest living[NL]
with my family herding sheep,[AN]
living the nomadic lifestyle.[AN]
Herding takes a lot of energy,[NL]
especially if you're on foot.[AN][ToggleSmile]
The rams liked to charge at me too.[AN]
That's a good way to find out[NL]
how fast you can be...[AN]
[MidRight]
Huh? Herding sheep?[AN]
That's the last thing I'd expect[NL]
someone like you to have been doing.[AN]
What made you go off on your own?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, it wasn't entirely by choice.[AN]
Our clan lost our rights to[NL]
our land in a dispute,[AN]
and we were forced to settle.[NL]
Sold all of our sheep too.[AN]
I couldn't stand staying[NL]
in one place like that.[AN]
So I took up the sword[NL]
and started wandering.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've been thinking lately about[NL]
doing some wandering, myself.[AN]
...Do you ever miss it?[NL]
Being with your family, I mean.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Every now and then,[NL]
I think about simpler times.[AN]
Working with my siblings[NL]
to take care of the flock,[AN]
helping a ewe in labor,[NL]
stuff like that.[AN]
But it's in the past now.[NL]
I said my goodbyes.[AN]
Wherever I end up[NL]
is wherever I end up.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh... Alright.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Woah, there. Didn't mean to[NL]
startle you that badly.[AN]
[Beat]Wait a second. Did you[NL]
put on some weight?[AN]
You're really slow today.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Er... Yeah! That's it.[AN]
I've been eating a lot,[NL]
y'know... Ha... Ha.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You sure have. But it wouldn't[NL]
explain why you seem to be[AN]
holding a critter inside your shirt.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Ya got me. It was supposed to[NL]
be a surprise.[.5] Gig's up, Woolt.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A... lamb?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, you seemed pretty down[NL]
the other day, and I felt bad for you.[AN]
I was gonna carve a herding staff[NL]
for you, but I accidentally[AN]
stumbled on Woolt while looking[NL]
for a good branch.[AN]
He seemed kinda lost, so I've been[NL]
lookin' after him for a bit.[AN]
I was gonna show you tonight[NL]
during our lesson.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A lost lamb, huh?[AN]
I wager that its mother is[NL]
looking for it as we speak.[AN]
[MidRight]
I... I didn't realize that[NL]
Woolt had a ma of his own.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry. We'll get him back[NL]
to his herd before dinner tonight.[AN]
If we can't find the shepherd...[NL]
He can be our secret for now.[AN]
[MidRight]
Huh?! You're not just[NL]
pulling my leg, are you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't have any reason to. But we[NL]
can't let the others know, alright?[AN]

It's a deal![AN]

Fernand![.4] There you are.[AN]
When I didn't see you on[NL]
the ballroom floor,[AN]
I was concerned you'd left already.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh, no.[AN]
My father would have my head[NL]
if I dared do something like that.[AN]
I just don't have[NL]
much taste for dancing.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha. That, I can understand.[AN]
I'm not sure if it's[NL]
only the wine talking,[AN]
but I was starting to[NL]
tire of it, myself.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's surprising.[AN]
Every noble lady in attendance[NL]
was falling all over herself[AN]
trying to be your dance partner.[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't mind the attention, per se,[NL]
but I do worry when my dearest friend[AN]
isn't having a good time.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You're a dashing fellow yourself--[AN]
we could have made an[NL]
unstoppable team out there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What, me picking up your leftovers?[AN]
Heh. No, I'd rather not.[NL]
I'd only make a fool of myself.[AN]
[MidRight]
You were perfectly good at it[NL]
when we practiced together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-Yes, well, that's different.[NL]
For one thing, we were alone.[AN]
And for another, it's different when[NL]
it's someone I've known my whole life.[AN]
[MidRight]
It'd be a shame for you to leave[NL]
a dance party without having been[AN]
on the floor at least once.[NL]
Why don't you be my partner this time?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
O-Oh--[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heavens, no![AN]
I mean-- I'm flattered, truly,[NL]
but imagine the stares we'd get.[AN]
There'd be gossip about us for months.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Ha ha! I'm sorry. You are just[NL]
too much fun to tease, Fernand.[AN]

while you're here.[AN]
