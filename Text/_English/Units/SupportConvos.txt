Every day we risk our lives in combat,[.4][NL]

[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] there was a traveling merchant[NL]
that was nearby camp the other day,[AN]
and I decided to see if there was[NL]
anything we didn't have stocked up.[AN]
I ended up finding these books[NL]
that looked kind of similar to[AN]

Argh...[.4] None of the spells I've read[NL]

[MidLeft][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
Do you remember that one time when[NL]
you burned the side of my house[AN]
when we were all kids?[AN]
You were practicing your fire magic[AN]
before Tobin and Gray came along[NL]
and messed up your aim.[AN]
[MidRight]
I remember getting an earful from[NL]
almost every woman in the village.[AN]
Didn't think I'd make it out alive[NL]
while they were yelling at me.[AN]

When I saw you casting that spell,[AN]
I remember that I wanted to be able[NL]

You were so fast,[.4] learning new spells[NL]

So,[.4] you were jealous?[AN]

In a way,[.4] I guess I was.[NL]
It's silly,[.4] isn't it?[AN]

Don't you know that magic has to[NL]
run through your blood?[AN]

Well,[.4] she never does[NL]

Look,[.4] it's not your problem.[AN]
Just leave it alone and[NL]

I hate getting the cold shoulder[NL]
from a friend because of[AN]
something stupid I said--[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe it was just a mistake to YOU,[AN]
but it's all I ever heard[NL]
out of that stupid village.[AN]
[0x93]She's so young![.4] Where's his father?[0x94][AN]

None of the village gossip[NL]

I had no idea it was that bad...[AN]

They didn't dare talk about[NL]
Sir Mycen's family like that.[AN]
And even if they did,[AN]
you were a tough enough kid[NL]
to hear it without crying.[AN][CloseEyes]
...I used to wish I were you instead.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You wished you were...[.4] me?[.4] Heh...[AN]
And all that time I was wishing[NL]
I could do the cool magic you do,[AN]

to have my mom around.[AN]

so different then,[.4] huh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Two outcast kids stranded[NL]
in the middle of nowhere.[AN]
I'd say we're pretty similar.[AN]

If you put it like that,[.4] it makes[NL]

I can't express how relieved I am[NL]

This whole time,[.4] I thought[NL]
you were gone for good...[AN]
[MidLeft]
I felt the same way, Anthiese.[AN]
At even the first mention of[NL]
[0x93]a girl with a mark on her hand[0x94],[AN]
I was already saddling my horse[NL]
without hearing the rest.[AN]
...Though,[.4] I did have a few[NL]

only one other would survive,[.4] I...[AN]
I am glad it was you.[AN]

Aww.[.4] You were always my favorite[NL]
sibling too, Anthiese.[AN]
Everyone else kept my mother and I at[NL]
arm's length,[.4] but not you and yours.[AN]

I was consumed by grief when they[NL]

ever since I first set out:[AN]
how did you manage to escape?[AN]

that night if I can help it.[AN]
Though,[.4] perhaps if we both get some[NL]
closure,[.4] we can both move on from it.[AN]
Why don't you go first?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh![.4] Of course.[AN]
My mother's handmaiden snuck me out[NL]
through an underground passage.[AN]
For what felt like ages I was[NL]
running through the night,[AN]
half-blind from crying.[AN]
We didn't stop until we were[NL]
well past the Rigel border.[AN]
[MidRight]
...In truth,[.4] I don't remember[NL]
much detail of the night itself.[AN]
It was...[.4] a lot,[.4] and I'd gotten[NL]
a lot of smoke in my lungs.[AN]
But a royal knight named Sir Mycen[NL]
took me and fled to a small village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I guess we ended up with a[NL]
pretty similar fate.[AN]
My mother had known the Sage Halcyon[NL]
when she still lived in Rigel,[AN]
so I took shelter in his hamlet[NL]
and grew up under his care.[AN]
[MidRight]
The places I grew up in were small,[.4] too,[.4][NL]
but thankfully I had friends in both.[AN]
You've met some of mine,[.4] so I'm[NL]
curious to know about yours.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Oh,[.4] I,[.4] um...[.4] never outgrew[NL]
my shyness,[.4] unfortunately.[AN]
Most of the few happy memories I[NL]
do have were of you and the villa.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Not that it was a bad life[NL]
with Halcyon,[.4] not at all![AN]
It was filled with long days of[NL]
sword practice and studying.[AN]
Not to mention doing all his[NL]
cleaning and cooking and laundry.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hee hee.[.4] Quite the downgrade,[NL]
for a royal son.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[.4] I didn't mind.[AN]
He was hiding me,[.4] and it's not[NL]
like there were servants around.[AN]
So if you ever get hungry,[.4][NL]
just say the word,[AN]
and I'll whip up something tasty![AN]

Since I was small,[.4] all I've ever wanted[NL]
was to become a knight.[AN]

I lost out on some of the best years[NL]

Oh,[.4] my dear Gray.[.4] Let me[N]

First,[.4] what do you want from me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm madly in love with you![N]
Isn't that part obvious enough?[AN]
[MidRight]
You do not even know[N]
the meaning of the word.[AN]
You think you can walk up to a woman[N]

You truly expect her to swoon[N]

[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] but[Beat] but[N]
I DO love you![AN]
[MidRight]
No.[.4] You do not.[.4] You WANT me.[N]
You intend to HAVE me.[AN]
But not at the expense of your pride.[AN]
You toss out kind words and I-love-yous[N]
without putting any weight behind them.[AN]
That way,[.4] if I refuse you,[.4] you can tell[N]
yourself it was all a jape in good fun.[AN]

But that's[Beat] not[NL]
how I feel at all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes,[.4] poor you.[N]

Mhmm.[.4] And a pretty damn good one, too.[AN]

And he gets to travel the world?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Uh-[.4]huh.[AN]

Has he ever told you stories[NL]

From the extravagant cities[NL]
in the heart of Zofia,[AN]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You must be jealous of him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not really.[AN]
He's always being hassled by[NL]
brigands and rogues,[AN]

journeys outside of Valentia.[AN]
I don't see how he can[NL]
stand being a merchant.[AN]
As it stands,[.4] we only just[NL]
make ends meet from his profits.[AN]
We'd be better off just harvesting[NL]

If I could travel the world[NL]

Oh,[.4] please.[AN]
Everyone knows you and your mother don't[NL]
exactly have the best relationship.[AN]

didn't even tell her you were leaving.[AN]

You were dazzled by all those[NL]

my mother comes from money.[AN]
They're always feeding me some sob story[NL]

So EXCUSE ME for being a little hesitant[NL]

[Beat] [Beat][AN]

I just wanted to check[NL]

Magic takes a toll[NL]

Er--[.4]yes,[.4] I was.[NL]
...Would you rather I didn't?[AN]

That wasn't what I meant.[NL]
I intended to communicate that,[.4] er...[AN]
that doesn't happen very often.[NL]
I was merely caught off guard.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see...[NL]
Luthier,[.4] I've noticed you don't[AN]
ask for help even when you've[NL]
exhausted your magic reserves.[AN]
So I wanted to be proactive and[NL]
see how you're doing.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's not necessary.[NL]
I know my limits.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well,[.4] I'm sure you do,[.4] but I would[NL]
prefer that no one in our group[AN]

I require your assistance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh--[.4]hello, Luthier.[NL]
How are you feeling?[AN]
Should I heal your wounds?[AN]
[MidRight]
No,[.4] there's no need for that.[NL]
Well--[.4]maybe as a demonstration.[AN]
You see,[.4] you've mastered a type[NL]
of magic I do not yet have command of.[AN]
Teach me your ways.[.4] I must study it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...Um,[.4] well,[.4] I'm not sure how much[NL]
I can teach...[AN]
White magic comes from faith and piety.[AN]
I could help lead you in prayer[NL]
sometime,[.4] but faith itself[AN]
isn't something I can teach.[AN]
[MidRight]
Obviously.[NL]
Magical ability comes from the blood.[AN]
But magical applications[NL]
come from intense study.[AN]
There must be some holy text or[NL]
ritual you perform to maintain[AN]
your communion with the spirits.[AN]
In this case,[.4] I should say,[.4][NL]
with Mila herself.[AN]
I presume she is the source of[NL]
healing magic,[.4] as described in[AN]
the Zofian Grimoire,[.4] page 47,[.4][NL]
paragraph 2.[AN][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
[0x93]The Mother giveth to the land[NL]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah,[.4] so you've read it too![AN]
I've been searching for someone[NL]
to discuss its merits with.[AN]
So few seem to have[NL]
truly studied the text.[AN]
I'm currently on my[NL]
one hundred and fifth re-read.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's very dedicated of y--[AN]
[MidRight]
--What did you think of the author's[NL]
description of the transfer of[AN]
life-force between caster and spirit?[NL]
I visualize it each time I cast.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Er,[.4] well,[.4] truthfully,[.4] I've only[NL]
skimmed it...[AN]
I know little of magic[NL]
beyond the church's teachings.[AN]
I preferred to learn through[NL]
practical applications--[AN]
healing the sick, meeting others[NL]
on pilgrimages...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You really must finish reading it.[NL]
I insist--[.4]it's life-changing.[AN]
It's my gift to you in knowledge[AN]
so that perhaps you will share[NL]
your knowledge with me.[AN]
I hope this can be the start of[NL]
a regular discussion on magical[AN]
study techniques.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...All right, Luthier.[NL]
Let's make a deal.[AN]
I'll read the whole book[AN]
if you can promise me[NL]
you'll put your health first.[AN]
Promise me that you'll come visit[NL]
me at the first sign of weariness.[AN]
--And don't stay up[NL]
all night reading.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Mm...[.4] I'm afraid that will be[NL]
tough to commit to.[AN]

of white magic,[NL]
then you have my word.[AN]

I thought seriously about[NL]

true that studying with others[AN]

You mentioned going out and meeting[NL]
others on pilgrimages.[AN]

It seems they only liked me when[NL]
I brought them fish, though.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah,[.4] that's a common misconception.[NL]
You may think them aloof creatures,[AN]
but when they turn and sit quietly[NL]
with their backs to you,[AN]
it's actually a sign of affection,[NL]
as the cat feels comfortable[AN]
enough to not have to keep watch[NL]
over y--[AN]
[MidRight]
--You know,[.4] Luthier,[.4] when you talk[NL]
about something you love,[AN]
your whole face lights up.[AN]

[Beat]Oh.[AN]
If I'm boring you,[NL]
please say so.[AN]

Oh,[.4] no,[.4] that's not a bad thing.[NL]
It's a sign of dedication and passion.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][NL]
[Beat][AN]
That's[Beat] the nicest thing[NL]
anyone has ever said to me.[AN]

All I ask is that you take[NL]
better care of yourself[AN]
so you can pursue those passions.[AN]
Put the candle out before[NL]
the rooster crows.[AN]
Get out and talk more with others[NL]
who love the same things you do.[AN]
I'm sure you'll find more friendly[NL]
ears than you thought you would.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]All right,[.4] I've decided.[NL]
I will venture forth and find a[AN]
commune of mages with whom I can[NL]
discuss my studies.[AN]
...Since you're the one who[NL]
inspired this idea,[AN]
I'd like to extend the invitation[NL]
to you as well.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Well,[.4] after the war ends...[AN]
It was my hope to give aid[NL]
to the people of Zofia[AN]
as they rebuild and recover.[AN]
But someday...[.4] I would like[NL]

come from?[.4] Perhaps he was shipwrecked?[AN]

And now you're fighting for a greater[NL]

from Desaix's Fortress?[AN]
And our conversation about...[.5] Alm?[AN]
[MidRight]
I remember it well.[AN]
But what exactly from that conversation[NL]
are you referring to, my love?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well...[.5] it seems I'm once again[NL]
doubting my past leadership.[AN]
Was letting Alm lead the Deliverance[NL]
a bad choice?[AN]
Were all of my past choices mistakes?[AN]
[MidRight]
Clive--[AN]
[MidLeft]
Every night after you had been captured,[NL]
I thought such things to myself.[AN]
Part of me even wondered if us starting[NL]
the Deliverance itself was a mistake,[AN]
if it had put you in such danger.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Clive,[.4] stop.[NL]
You're not thinking straight.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidRight]
Had your past choices been mistakes,[NL]
we would not be here.[AN]
We would be serving under Rigel's rules.[AN]
And we would not be together,[NL]
like we are now.[AN]
Please don't second guess your choices.[AN]
Look how far we've come,[.4] and then[NL]
tell me those choices were mistakes.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...Thank you,[.4] my love.[NL]
That reassurance was most needed.[AN]

There's no need to flatter me at[NL]

Because it's my faith in you that gives[NL]

I must confess,[.4] our last discussion[NL]

I seek to close the rift between the[NL]
Deliverance's nobles and commomers.[AN]
But there are days when it seems[NL]
to only grow wider.[AN]
Have I not endeavored to treat those[NL]
of low birth fairly?[AN]
I always thought to reward my men based[NL]
on merit,[.4] not station.[AN]
And yet you believe that some[NL]
still struggle to fit in.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] you won't win any points by[NL]
using terms like [0x93]low birth[0x94]. [Beat]Sir.[AN]
You make it sound like it's our[NL]

then all we really have are our merits.[AN]

I never meant to slight you,[NL]
Python.[.4] Nor anyone else.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I know that.[.4] And anyway,[.4] you[NL]
didn't create the order of the world.[AN]
It ain't your fault.[AN]
But respectfully and all?[.4] You might[NL]
wanna stop preaching understanding.[AN]
You can't understand us.[.4] Not really.[NL]
Your life is just very [Beat]different.[AN]

You're right.[.4] I've never had to worry[NL]

indignities or despair as you.[AN]
Yet in trying to champion those causes,[NL]
perhaps I have become a hypocrite.[AN]

Python,[.4] I believe in structure.[AN]
There should be a king and a nobility,[NL]

You may not know what it is[NL]
to starve or freeze,[AN]
but you still put your life and[NL]
livelihood at risk for others' sake.[AN]
That's enough to win my respect.[AN]
I mean,[.4] it's sure as hell something[NL]
you'll never catch ME doing![AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
So even if you don't have[NL]
my undying affection,[AN]

[MidRight]
Wuh-[.4]oh.[.4] That's not good.[NL]
What'd it say?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] er[Beat] he wrote,[.4] [0x93]I have no son,[NL]

In the next paragraph,[.4] he wrote,[.4][NL]
[0x93]The matter which remains unresolved[AN]
is that of my eldest child,[.4] his sister,[.4][NL]
who deserted us some ten years ago.[0x94][AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah,[.4] that's odd all right,[.4] considering[NL]
he didn't have a daughter,[.4] either.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're sure of this...?[AN]
I recall him hosting my father and I[NL]
at his summer villa once yearly,[AN]
from when I was very young.[NL]
While our fathers discussed governance,[AN]
Fernand and I were left to play[NL]
with the lord's son and daughter.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Hey, I just told you,[.4] pal,[.4][NL]
he didn't have a--[AN]
[MidLeft]
His son was sickly,[.4] much younger,[.4] and[NL]
lacked the constitution for the sort of[AN]
mischief Fernand and I once enjoyed.[NL]
But his daughter,[.4] on the other hand--[AN]
that child could roughhouse with the[NL]
best of us.[.4] She had a wit like a rapier,[AN]

Our faces all ached with mirth by[NL]
the time the bonfire was doused.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That,[.4] uh,[.4] sure does sound like[NL]
somebody hard to forget about.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yet behind that easygoing smile was[NL]
a fierce independence,[.4] which grew[AN]
only bolder when the nursemaids[AN]
demanded she keep silent and[NL]
start acting like a lady.[AN]
She was every bit as stubborn as[NL]
her father,[.4] and not even his own[AN]
thunderous admonishments could[NL]
bend her will to his.[AN]
[MidRight]
I mean,[.4] you don't get billed[NL]
as the Iron Fist of the West[AN]
for being a nice guy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I valued that friendship more and more[NL]
with each year we summered there.[AN]
And then,[.4] perhaps ten years ago,[.4][NL]
I learned that our last visit together[AN]
had already passed.[.4] When I asked[NL]

And speaking of matters of the purse...[AN]
I wrote your father that I had found[NL]
some potentially useful information,[AN]
but I declined to give further details.[AN]
Instead,[.4] I inquired as to the nature[NL]
of your due portion of the estate.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thanks, pal.[NL]
So?[.4] What's the payout?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well...[.4] seeing as your mother was not[NL]
the lady of the house,[.4] your brother[AN]
will inherit its assets and titles.[NL]
Only the following would be yours:[AN]
your mother's wardrobe, jewelry box,[NL]
and all corresponding contents.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Urgh.[.4] Even from halfway in the grave[NL]
he's trying to tell me what to wear.[AN]
So, yeah,[.4] he's still the same tyrant[NL]
he always was.[.4] Hasn't changed a bit.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm...[.4] Even so,[.4] you could opt to sell,[.4][NL]
perhaps?[.4] From the sound of things,[AN]
you could live quite comfortably[NL]
on even a part of the proceeds.[AN]
[MidRight]
Not happening.[.4] This isn't a gift,[.4] it's[NL]
another one of his dumb power plays.[AN]
In his mind,[.4] accepting any of it puts[NL]
me in debt to him and proves I can't[AN]
live my own life without his [0x93]help[0x94].[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
*sigh*[.4] I had feared as much.[NL][OpenEyes]
He is a famously stubborn man,[.4] and[AN]
it seems we were right to doubt even[NL]
the spectre of death could change him.[AN]
[MidRight]
Unluckily for him,[.4] I'm just as stubborn.[NL][ToggleSmile]
So,[.4] uh,[.4] what're you gonna write back?[AN]
I assume you've got a nicer way[NL]
of telling him exactly where[AN]
he can shove those jewels.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Haha...[.4] If only for your brother's sake,[NL]
I will keep my reply diplomatic.[AN]
But I vow to make your refusal clear.[NL]
I'd advise you that a serious answer to[AN]
where those jewels might go would leave[NL]
him no room to push the matter further.[AN]
[MidRight]
Eh,[.4] whoever my brother ends up marrying[AN]
can have 'em.[.4] Pretty sure that's what[NL]
my mom would've wanted,[.4] anyway.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Duly noted.[.4] Now then,[NL]
how to draft the rest of this...[AN]
Perhaps this task warrants a few more[NL]
tankards of ale,[.4] wouldn't you say?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ha![.4] Sounds like a plan to me.[AN]

Oh![.4] I'm glad to hear it.[.4] I was really[NL]

No, no,[.4] it was a lovely gift![AN]
I didn't mean to come across[NL]
as ungrateful at all.[AN]
I'm sorry I gave you doubts.[AN]

It just really worried me that you[NL]
didn't want to eat them right away.[AN]
Especially after I saw you eating[NL]
raw flour like nothing was wrong...[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well,[.4] they were special![AN]
You baked them, and the ingredients[NL]
must have been expensive.[AN]
I didn't want to just gobble them up on a[NL]

I wanted to make sure I enjoyed them.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]
Boey,[.4] raw flour isn't normal food![AN]
I wouldn't eat raw flour unless[NL]
I was really, really hungry.[AN]
That's why I got so worried[NL]
and made extra cookies.[AN]
I was scared you weren't[NL]
getting enough to eat...[AN]
[MidRight]
Is it really that strange...?[NL]
I ate it a lot growing up.[AN]
I had lots of brothers and sisters,[NL]
and my dad was a poor fisherman.[AN]
Sometimes, we didn't even have enough[NL]
to buy ingredients to make bread.[AN]
Raw flour was all we had.[NL]
So, I got used to it.[AN][ToggleSmile]
In a way, it sort of reminds me[NL]
of family dinners, heh.[AN]

a new recipe I've just tried out.[NL]
Would you mind having a sample of this?[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidLeft][.6]

I'd be delighted to.[NL]
But,[.4] if I might ask--[.5]why me?[AN]
I'm afraid I don't have much in[NL]
the way of a refined palate.[AN]
If you're looking for specific feedback,[NL]
I'm not really the person to ask.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You needn't fret so.[.4] This may be a[NL]
taste test,[.4] but it's not an exam.[AN]
There's no risk of a failing mark.[AN]

it suits your taste or not.[AN]

If you insist,[.4] then...[NL][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]

like more than a hearty meal.[AN]
You went to all this trouble just for[NL]
me?[.4] What have I done to deserve THIS?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, it was no trouble at all,[.4] really.[NL]
I cook because I enjoy the process.[AN]
Though it's but a simple gesture,[.5] please[NL]
accept it as part of my apology for[AN]
having deceived you all for so long.[AN]
The circumstances required it,[.4] but[NL]
I am deeply sorry all the same.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Simple?![.5] This is an apology and a half![NL]
I must make up the difference somehow.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No,[.4] please,[.4] you don't owe me a thing.[NL]
Consider the scales balanced.[AN]
[MidRight]
Please,[.4] I insist.[.5] Why don't I help[NL]

I'm sure you could use an extra[NL]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I must thank you again for your[NL]
help in the kitchen yesterday.[AN]
Anthiese told me the scaloppine sauce[NL]
was just as it was in the royal villa![AN]
[MidRight]
Really?[.4] That's excellent![.4] Heh...[NL]
I was worried I wasn't doing enough.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You could stand to be more generous[NL]
with the spices,[.4] but you have a natural[AN]
aptitude for flavor combinations.[AN]
With a bit more practice,[.4] you'd[NL]
make a fantastic cook yourself.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'd be honored to keep on learning[NL]
from such a seasoned chef.[AN][MoveMidRight]
...No pun intended,[.4] of course.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha![.4] And I'd be glad to take you on[NL]
as an apprentice.[.4] It's a rare sight[AN]
indeed to find someone else who views[NL]
cooking as a hobby rather than a chore.[AN]
Especially another man.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
Really?[.4] What does being a man[NL]
have to do with that?[AN]
Plenty of men love cooking.[NL]
My father was a master of the art of[AN]
wood-grilled trout when he could catch[NL]
enough to spare for the family.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I suppose it's only in Rigel,[.4] then,[.4][NL]
that it's considered women's work.[AN]
In the village,[.4] I could scarcely find[NL]
someone willing to teach a boy to cook,[AN]
even when I offered to do all the work.[AN]
I finally happened upon a blind old maid[NL]
who begrudgingly accepted--[.4]and even so,[AN]
I'm sure she'd have turned me away[NL]
as well if she'd seen my face.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?![.4] That's absurd.[AN]
Who in their right mind refuses[NL]
help from a neighbor?[AN]
Were they really that distrustful of[NL]
you just for wanting to help cook?[AN]
Or might it have been disdain[NL]
for your Zofian roots?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps a bit of both.[.4] Rigelians are[NL]
fiercely independent,[.4] and take umbrage[AN]
at any insinuation they might need[NL]
help they didn't [0x93]earn[0x94].[AN]
And,[.4] given that the Sage's Hamlet was[NL]
something of a refuge for church elders[AN]
and devout followers,[.4] there were few[NL]
youths and even fewer foreigners.[AN]
Heh...[.4] Needless to say,[.4] it's a welcome[NL]
surprise to have a friend my age[AN]
to share my hobby with.[AN]
[MidRight]
I can understand.[.4] In the priory,[NL]
all my peers were priestesses.[AN]
Not that I don't appreciate my friends,[NL]
but it's nice to finally count a fellow[AN]
my own age among them.[.4] I'd be glad[NL]
to keep on cooking with you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh...[.4] Then,[.4] from this day forward,[.4][NL]
you shall be my apprentice[AN]
in the culinary arts![.4] I vow to[NL]
teach you everything I know.[AN]

As your culinary apprentice,[NL]

Most certainly.[NL]
What is your concern?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat] There's a certain someone[NL]

it seems that our every conversation[NL]
ends in me making a fool of myself.[AN]

Do you mean Anthiese?[AN]

things a bit more difficult.[AN]
Does this young lady have a[NL]
favorite dish you know of?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm...[.4] She's fond of sweets,[.4] but not[NL]
of foods that are overly rich.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Drat.[.4] That rules out my signature[NL]
Rigelian fried cheesecakes.[AN]
Though,[.4] I've something in mind[NL]
that would suit such a palate.[AN]
I hope your arms are prepared[NL]
for some serious whisking.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ha![.4] Maybe she'll appreciate the[NL]
extra muscle I'll be building.[AN]
[Beat]That said,[.4] what else might I do[NL]
to convince her I'm serious?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hah...[.4] I'm afraid matters of romance[NL]
are completely foreign to me.[AN]
In truth,[.4] I don't give much thought[NL]
to such matters at all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Really?[.4] That's a surprise.[AN]
I'd think a gallant, mysterious knight[NL]
would have no shortage of admirers.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I suppose so--[.4]but I scarcely notice[NL]
their intentions until long after[AN]
they've given up on the conversation![AN]
I can do little more than simmer[NL]
silently in my own cluelessness.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha![.4] It must be the mask.[AN]
I'd imagine it'd be easy to mistake[NL]
that for a stoic air of mystery.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha![.4] Would you like to borrow it?[AN]
Perhaps an air of mystery[NL]
is the secret weapon you need![AN]
[MidRight]
Ahaha...[.4] Somehow I get the impression[AN]
she'd think me even more of a fool[NL]
if I tried such a thing.[AN]

you know that,[.4] right?[AN]
Though I gotta say,[NL]

For all his posturing about ruling[NL]

an emperor has been letting the Duma[NL]

Quite frankly,[.4] it's not enough.[NL]
I don't think I'll be satisfied until[AN]

Selling your sword to spice merchants[NL]

The dried laurel leaves add[NL]

BETTER than home,[.4] even.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
So it was a success,[.4] then![NL]
I've been interested in making some[AN]
of my mother's favorite dishes,[NL]
but with Zofian spices blended in.[AN]
There's something about the heartiness[NL]
of Rigelian cuisine that's a comfort[AN]
in this cold weather,[.4] but it's so[Beat][NL]
Well,[.4] let's just say I understand[AN]
why this dish isn't popular abroad.[AN]
I thought a bit of a Zofian touch[NL]
might make it taste more[Beat] welcoming.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I get that.[.5] Hard to go back[NL]
to butter and potatoes once you've[AN]
had a taste of olives and figs.[AN]
[MidRight]
There's no need for us to go back![AN]
Think of all the new culinary[NL]
possibilities we could create.[AN]
Our old favorites,[.4] made new.[AN]
We're better for it for having[NL]
had that taste in the first place.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll say.[.5] Didn't think so at the time,[NL]
but leaving Rigel was the best thing[AN]
I ever did for myself.[AN]
There's no place for a piece of work[NL]
like me in a land like that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Try as I might,[.4] I never did belong[NL]
there either.[.5] I went as far as[AN]
wearing a mask to hide the parts of me[NL]
that stuck out too far to fit in.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm.[.4][ToggleSmile] I thought it was because[NL]
you needed a disguise.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
W-[.4]Well,[.4] that,[.4] too.[.5][ToggleSmile] But it isn't[NL]
necessary anymore,[.4] is it?[AN]
When Rigel had no room for you,[.4] you[NL]
made room for yourself somewhere else.[AN]
I got to thinking that perhaps[NL]
I was capable of the same.[AN]
I could make room for myself somewhere[NL]
in between,[.4] using what I'd learned[AN]
on both sides of the border.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A place like that does sound[NL]
pretty nice.[.5] Maybe even better if,[.4][AN]
say,[.4] some talented cook wanted to open a[NL]
tavern specializing in fusion cuisine.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heehee.[.5] Such a cook would probably[NL]
be interested in contracting a[AN]
spice transport specialist,[.4] if such[NL]
a thing were to come to pass.[AN]
But now is perhaps too early to dwell[NL]
on it when Anthiese yet needs our help.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] she's counting on us both.[NL]
So don't go dying on her,[.4] all right?[AN]
I'll stick around to make sure[NL]
you don't get yourself killed,[.4] kid.[AN]

before becoming a mercenary?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hey,[.4] chief,[.4] no offense,[.4] but...[NL]
You're my boss,[.4] not my friend.[AN]
I've got a policy of not getting[NL]
too attached on jobs like this.[AN]
You never know who's going to[NL]
up and die on you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Whoa,[.4] okay,[.4] I get it.[AN]
You don't have to answer[NL]
if you don't want to.[AN]
I was just trying to[NL]
make conversation.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Relax,[.4] I was just messing with you.[NL]
I was a shepherd,[.4] believe it or not.[AN]
My family and I roamed the steppes,[NL]
taking our yurts where the grass grew.[AN]
We sold wool and carpets and made decent[NL]
money.[.4][ToggleSmile] Sometimes,[.4] I miss that life.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] if you miss it that much,[NL]
why don't you go back?[AN]
[MidRight]
Can't really live that way of life[NL]
without land. And if the land wasn't[AN]
given to you by the gods,[.4] well,[AN]
the only way to get it back is[NL]
with cold, hard cash.[AN]
My folks scraped up just enough to[NL]
move to a village and settle down,[AN]
but that kind of life isn't for me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
So you're looking to buy[NL]
your land back,[.4] is that it?[AN]
[MidRight]
It'd be nice,[.4] sure,[.4] but who knows?[AN]
Maybe I'd want to take a boat trip[NL]
to another continent first.[AN]
I just want to have enough saved up to[NL]
do whatever I want without worrying.[AN]
And planning for stuff is[NL]
just another worry.[AN]

Kamui.[.4] Did you need something?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've come to talk.[NL]
What was your life before all of this?[AN]
Before this holy mission and the[NL]
mess with Barth and whatnot,[.4] I mean.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] it was a happy life.[.4] I had a[NL]
beautiful wife and a promising son.[AN]
My parents and siblings lived close,[NL]
too, so it was never a lonely life.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Sometimes I look back and[NL]
miss those days,[.4] truth be told.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry.[.4] I didn't mean[NL]
to reopen old wounds.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No,[.4] it's fine,[.4] Kamui.[.4] I'll live.[AN]
Whenever I think of them now,[.4] I'm[NL]
filled with nothing but happiness,[AN]
knowing that I was able to spend[NL]
the time with them that I did.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's pretty optimistic.[AN]
Do you have any idea what you're[NL]
going to do after the war?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you'd asked me a few months ago,[AN]
I'd probably have given you[NL]
a pretty depressing answer.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But now?[.4] It's been an honor to[NL]
serve the Princess like this.[AN]
Makes me think about going back[NL]
to the Knights of Zofia. [Beat]You know,[AN]
if you wanted an in with them,[NL]
I could probably get you one.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh.[.4] We make a hell of a team, Valbar,[NL]
and the world could use people like us.[AN]
But I think I'd rather stick[NL]
to the mercenary life.[AN]
If you ever feel like freelancing[NL]
a bit, maybe we could team up again.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll give it some thought.[NL]

Hear me out.[AN]
The squadron you once led[NL]

the mantle of knighthood.[AN]
While they were on patrol,[NL]
Barth and his pirates caught them[AN]

My wife and children were slaughtered.[AN]

I've broken all ties with[NL]

Getting chastised by one is[NL]

No need.[.4] I got my answer,[.4] and I've[NL]
no blame left to put on you.[AN]

All my life I've been told revenge[NL]
only leaves you empty and wanting.[AN]
Am I really a good person if[NL]
crushing a pirate's skull[AN]

I tell her it's for me,[.4] and she looks[NL]

It'd hardly be a fair match if she did.[AN]

[MidLeft] 
Well,[.4] I wasn't always a mercenary.[AN]
I used to make an honest living[NL]
with my family herding sheep,[AN]
living the nomadic lifestyle.[AN]
Herding takes a lot of energy,[NL]
especially if you're on foot.[AN][ToggleSmile]
The rams liked to charge at me too.[AN]

That's the last thing I'd expect[NL]
someone like you to have been doing.[AN]
What made you go off on your own?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well,[.4] it wasn't entirely by choice.[AN]
Our clan lost our rights to[NL]
our land in a dispute,[AN]
and we were forced to settle.[NL]
Sold all of our sheep too.[AN]
I couldn't stand staying[NL]
in one place like that.[AN]
So I took up the sword[NL]
and started wandering.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've been thinking lately about[NL]
doing some wandering,[.4] myself.[AN]

Being with your family,[.4] I mean.[AN]

Every now and then,[NL]
I think about simpler times.[AN]
Working with my siblings[NL]

in poetry,[.4] and music,[.4] and...[.4] Hmmm...[AN][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]
Oh![.4] He should own four villas,[NL]
one for each of the seasons![AN]
[Beat]Does that narrow it down?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][HalfCloseEyes]It certainly does.[NL][OpenEyes]
You just described your brother.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
That is not true![AN]
[MidLeft]
And you don't even realize it...[NL]
Clearly you are still a child.[AN]
You won't find a husband if you keep[NL]
clinging to your brother in such a way.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] really?[.4] And what about you?[AN]
You've been clinging to my brother[NL]
since before I was born, Fernand.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Is there anything YOU should be[NL]
telling me,[.4] hmmmmm?[.4] After all,[AN]
you aren't exactly scrambling to[NL]
find a pretty maid of your own.[AN][ToggleSmile]

W-[.4]We are NOT talking about me![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha![.4] Look at you,[.4] so easily shaken![NL]
I was merely teasing.[AN]
Besides,[.4] Clive already told me[NL]
what your true weakness is.[AN]
He claims you prefer your ladies[NL]
like your oranges:[.4] full and ripe.[AN]
Now which of the knights' eligible[NL]
ladies is juicy enough for you?[.4] Hmm...[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I am going to find your brother[NL]
and bury him in a very deep hole...[AN][OpenEyes]

Keep your voice down.[NL]
What is it?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You'll never guess what I brought[NL]
for you.[.4] Those buffoons who[AN]
captured me didn't search my rucksack.[NL]
Which means[Beat] voil[0xE0]![AN]

Lemon[Beat] tartlets?[AN]

Baked by my maidservant,[.4] just the way[NL]
we had them at home![.4] Your favorite.[AN]

[Beat]And why,[.4] may I ask,[.4] are you[NL]
offering these to me on a battlefield[AN]
after they have been in your rucksack[NL]
for gods-know how long?[AN]
[MidRight]
You looked so very glum,[.4] Fernand.[AN]
I couldn't bear it.[.5] I wanted to[NL]
give you a little taste of home.[AN]
I thought it might raise your[NL]
spirits a little.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
We are KNIGHTS now,[.4] Clair.[AN]
We cannot afford to dally around[NL]
playing[Beat][MoveMidLeft] playing house![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
It isn't as if I expect you to unfurl[NL]
tablecloth and teaware right here![AN]
The tarts are small enough to just[NL]
pop in your mouth and be on your way.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Hmph.[.4] Better that you'd have[NL]
burnt them,[.4] in that case.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Fernand![.4] Stop that.[NL]
You know I did not mean that.[AN]
I meant when it was the three of us.[NL]
You were like a second brother to--[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes][MoveMidLeft]
Enough,[.4] Clair![NL]
Those days are behind us.[AN]
Am I now to you just[NL]
a thing to be pitied?![AN]
Spare me the indignity.[AN]
We are soldiers now,[.4] and our duty[NL]
is to fight or die trying.[AN]
If you are to be a knight,[NL]
you must accept that.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
And if you insist on pestering me[NL]
again,[.4] can you please try to refrain[AN]
from trumpeting your arrival[NL]
to friend and foe alike?![AN]
I intend on delivering you to[NL]
your brother in[.4] one[.4] piece.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You are tired,[.4] Fernand.[.5] As is such,[NL]
I will be the one delivering YOU.[AN]

Excuse me?[AN]

Look at yourself![NL]
You've run yourself ragged.[AN]
Leave the front to me,[.4][NL]

A moment,[.4] please.[NL]
Mathilda,[.4] was it?[AN]
[MidRight]
Right,[.4] and you are[Beat]?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Fernand.[.4] You would do well to[NL]
remember your comrades,[.4] milady.[AN]
[MidRight]
Please do forgive me,[.4] sir.[NL]
With how many recruits pass through[AN]
these halls,[.4] I find it difficult[NL]
to commit every one to memory.[AN]
Training occupies my thoughts[AN]
night and day,[.4] and I fear it's[NL]
left me with little room for names.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I suppose that counts for something.[NL]
Your efforts seem to have earned you[AN]
quite the prestigious reputation[NL]
among the Knights of Zofia.[AN]
[Beat]Your family must be proud of you.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I am honored to carry on my father's[NL]
legacy.[.4] As his firstborn,[.4] I sought[AN]
to follow in his footsteps,[.4] and trained[NL]
tirelessly with him from a young age.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What of your brothers,[.4] then?[AN]
Surely they,[.4] too,[.4] would aspire to[NL]
the glory of knighthood.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've only sisters,[.4] sir.[NL]
Four of them,[.4] all younger.[AN]
And I am the only one who chose[NL]
the lance over the distaff.[AN]
They're quite content to have[NL]
nothing to do with the art--[AN][ToggleSmile]
and horrors--[.4]of war.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][OpenEyes]Don't you want to be like them?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Pardon?[AN]
[MidLeft]
As noblewomen,[.4] no more is expected of[NL]
them than to stay in their estate.[AN]
Like a caged bird by a windowsill,[AN]
suitors will flock around them,[.4] and[NL]
they'll have their pick of the best.[AN]
Quite the luxurious lifestyle,[.4] indeed.[AN]
[MidRight]
[CloseEyes][Beat][OpenEyes][AN]
[MidLeft]
As the lovebirds meet,[.4] they will court,[NL]
marry,[.4] and[.4] continue their bloodline.[AN]
Is that not a preferable alternative to[NL]
the ever-present perils of knighthood?[AN]
Knights must gamble their life on[NL]
either glory or death in combat.[AN]
[MidRight]
It is much more dangerous,[.4] indeed.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Yet,[.4] I am not the kind to just[NL]
sit idly by and enjoy the flowers.[AN]
This is the path my family and I have[NL]
chosen,[.4] and I walk it with pride.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see.[.4] Your words ring true.[AN]
Keep your head held high,[NL]
Lady Mathilda.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thank you,[.4] sir.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You needn't call me [0x93]sir[0x94] if we're[NL]
to be comrades,[.4] you know.[AN]

Lady Mathilda.[NL]
Did you need something?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am looking for Clive.[AN]
[MidRight]
We're not attached at[NL]
the hip,[.4] you know.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
No,[.4] but you ARE like brothers.[AN]
Perhaps I just think of you[NL]
as a single entity.[.4] Ha ha.[AN]
In any case,[.4] pray forgive me[NL]
if I upset you.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm not upset.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Are you certain?[.4] It seems[NL]
every time I try to talk to you,[AN]
you refuse to look me in the eye.[AN]
If I did something wrong,[.4] tell me.[NL]
I don't want you to hate me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hate you?[.4] Of course not.[NL]
But all you ever ask about is Clive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh[Beat]right.[AN]
I can see how that would[NL]
be grating.[.4] It's just...[AN][ToggleSmile]
Well,[.4] your stories about Clive are[AN]
far more interesting than[NL]
the ones he tells.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
For true?[AN]
I can't imagine what I could tell you[NL]
that he hasn't already.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Oh,[.4] if you only knew.[AN]
I adore talking with him,[.4] but[Beat][NL][OpenEyes]
Well,[.4] he doesn't know how to loosen up.[AN]
He's very self-conscious.[AN]
I want to hear about his misadventures,[NL]
not just what he thinks I want to hear.[AN]
[MidRight]
So he never told you about sneaking[NL]
into the mess hall before lunch?[AN]
Or the story of licking the[NL]
cream off the cake?[AN]
Surely he's told you about trying[NL]
to ride those sheep?![AN]
He scared them so much,[AN]
they fled the pen and[NL]
rampaged across the village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha ha![.4] I fear he neglected to[NL]
mention any of those escapades.[AN]
[MidRight]
He may look all gallant and composed,[NL]
but let me tell you...[AN]
Clive can be quite the ruffian when[NL]
no one is looking.[AN]
He makes me look like a saint.[NL]
I suggest you be careful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your suggestion is noted.[AN]
This is why I like talking[NL]
to you,[.4] Fernand.[AN]
[Beat]But it's not the only reason.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course I enjoy hearing about Clive.[AN]
But I also enjoy watching you[NL]
as you tell the stories.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Is that so?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your eyes light up when you[NL]
talk about him.[AN]
I can tell how happy it was for[NL]
the two of you to grow up together.[AN]
It's a type of affection that[NL]
he and I will never have.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] I wouldn't say that...[AN]
[MidLeft]
All I know is that I'd love to see[NL]
the site of Clive's sheep rampage,[AN]
or visit the kitchen where you[NL]
defrocked that poor cake.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well,[.4] I'd be happy to take you.[NL]
And I'm not just saying that.[AN]
We can all go together:[NL]
you,[.4] me,[.4] and Clive.[AN]

Thank you, Fernand.[NL]
I would love that.[AN]

he actually asked.[AN]

This is[Beat] the first I've heard[NL]

Oh,[.4] I think enough has[NL]

[Beat]Is it because Clive didn't speak[NL]

I assure you--[.4]it isn't as if[NL]

In fact,[.4] Clive insisted that[NL]
you'd be his best man--[AN]

Is that supposed to be some sort[NL]

Do I look like the type of man[NL]
