Mycen: Come now, Nomah, we must keep up the pace. We can't let these youths outpace us.
Nomah: You've always been a fountain of energy, Mycen.
Mycen: Training those kids... it's certainly kept me on my toes these years.
Nomah: Well, you've done a fine job raising them into fine individuals and soldiers.
Mycen: Don't sell yourself short. I could hardly recognize Lady Celica when I met her again. She's grown into a fine young woman under your tutelage. Surely, I was correct in my judgment to trust her in your care.
Nomah: Oh ho, Mycen, you flatter me. Young Alm reminds me a bit of you. 
Mycen: That boy's come a long way. I'm proud of him.
Nomah: As you should be. He's even mastered your brand of stubbornness!
Mycen: What?! 
Nomah: Ha! Seems even after all of these years, not much has changed.
Mycen: Hm, perhaps so... old friend.

Nomah: Mycen, you mustn't push yourself so hard. You've been taking night watch for almost two weeks straight. You need to get your rest.
Mycen: You've always been one to fuss. I'm simply doing my duty.
Nomah: Sigh... Once a mule, always a mule.
Mycen: If you want a job done well, you do it yourself. Isn't that the same reason why you take on cooking duty so frequently? Certainly more than your fair share.
Nomah: Cooking is a form of expression. These youths have given up so much... it is the least I can do.
Mycen: So certainly you can understand why I push myself, too.
Nomah: Mm, you were always one to forge your own path. 
Mycen: If I don't have to leave things to chance, I won't. Simple as that.
Nomah: Perhaps not in matters of life and death, but there's nothing wrong with going with the flow... especially at our age.
Mycen: Your breezy outlook has always made me envious... You always seem so at ease, even in the midst of battle.
Nomah: I'm surprised you even care to notice me when you're in the thick of battle.
Mycen: Of course... I'm always looking after those I care for.
Nomah: Mycen...

Nomah: Mycen.
Mycen: Yes, what is it, Nomah? Come to chastise me again for pushing myself too hard?
Nomah: No, not this time. I wanted to ask you about your plans... The final battle is fast approaching. I wonder what will come next.
Mycen: Not like you to want to plan ahead. What's on your mind?
Nomah: The children we've reared are fully grown. They won't need us anymore once the fighting is done. It's had me thinking about my plans for what's next.
Mycen: Not simply letting fate decide? I'm surprised.
Nomah: Surely, you've thought about it. Haven't you?
Mycen: ... I was actually planning on asking you.
Nomah: Mycen...
Mycen: Yes, Nomah?
Nomah: Perhaps we could give us... another try. 
Mycen: Nomah... it was so long ago.
Nomah: ... And spending all of this time together again reminded me of those good times we shared when we were young and idealistic. And being out here, traveling with you all... it's made me feel like I haven't felt in a long time. With all this in mind... I'd like for us to be together again. 
Mycen: Nomah, I...
Nomah: I know this is unlike me... but it's like you said. You can't always leave everything up to fate.
Mycen: Nomah... I'd be lying if I said I didn't start to feel it again, too. But I still think Alm and Celica will need some older and wiser heads around to help out with administration. Do you think you'd be happy in the hustle and bustle of the castle town?
Nomah: Heh. You're saying this as if I didn't just spend years overseeing an entire priory. Just promise me we'll go sailing now and again.
Mycen: Yes... I think that will do quite nicely. Together again...
Nomah: Mycen...



Boey/Genny - maybe bring up Boey's poor past and him eating some stale bread or flour or w/e and she's like wtf

Boey/Genny C
Boey: Whew, I'm starving. I suppose no one would mind if I picked something out of the provisions stock... Oh! This'll do.[.6]
Genny: Um... Boey? Are you... feeling okay?
Boey: Fuah? 'M fihe. Huay?
Genny: You're... You're eating flour... Like, raw flour.
Boey: Gulp... Er, yes, uh, did you need it for baking? I-I'm deeply sorry if I've left you without enough for your recipe.
Genny: No, we've got plenty of flour... I just... How can you eat that stuff raw?
Boey: Uh... Well, I was hungry, and I didn't feel like taking the time to bake it into bread. I mean, it tastes fine on its own anyhow.
Genny: Um... If you say so.[AN][ClearFace]
Boey: ...Is it really that strange?

Boey/Genny B
Genny: Hi, Boey... I brought you something. 
Boey: Oh? Well, whatever it is, it smells lovely.
Genny: I helped out with baking cookies this morning and we made too many. So I thought you might like to have some.
Boey: Gods, these look lovely! I can't ruin them by eating them all.
Genny: ...Well, really, these were the ones I made and they came out kind of lumpy. Ehehe...
Boey: Oh. Well, I can't wait to dig in...
[.6]
Genny: ...Aren't you going to try them?
Boey: I, uh, well, we're in the midst of a battle, aren't we?
Genny: I... I just want to make sure you're eating. Y-You know, keeping your strength up!
Boey: Oh, I'm fine, no need to worry! I'll hold onto these for a special occasion.
Genny: O-Oh... Okay. I-I understand...[AN][ClearFace]
Boey: W-Wait! ...Blast. I've done it again...

Boey/Genny A
Boey: ...Hey, Genny? I finally tried one of the cookies you made. It was really tasty. Thank you.
Genny: Oh! I'm glad to hear it. I was really worried you didn't like them.
Boey: No, no, it was a lovely gift! I didn't mean to come across as ungrateful at all. I'm sorry I gave you doubts.
Genny: It just really worried me that you didn't want to eat them right away. Especially after I saw you eating raw flour like nothing was wrong...
Boey: Well, they were special! You baked them, and the ingredients must have been expensive. I didn't want to just gobble them down on a battlefield like they were normal food. I wanted to make sure I enjoyed them.
Genny: Boey, raw flour isn't normal food! I wouldn't eat raw flour unless I was really, really hungry. That's why I got so worried and made extra cookies. I was scared you weren't getting enough to eat...
Boey: Is it really that strange...? I ate it a lot growing up. I had lots of brothers and sisters, and my dad was a poor fisherman. Sometimes, we didn't even have enough to buy ingredients to make bread. Raw flour was all we had. So, I got used to it. In a way, it kinda reminds me of family dinners, heh.
Genny: I... I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Boey. I thought it was something sad and desperate. I was wrong to treat you like some kind of charity case.
Boey: No harm done, Genny. I know you didn't mean to hurt my feelings. But, I certainly wouldn't mind sampling more of your baking!
Genny: Hee hee... Well, I'll just have to bake you some apology cookies, then!


Leon/Sonya: 

C

Sonya: Hey, you. You with the great eyeliner.
Leon: How sweet of you to notice, gorgeous. What can I do for you?
Sonya: Hee hee. Well, I just wanted to ask how you manage to keep it looking like this in the heat. Mine always gets smudged...
Leon: Well, of course it'll get smudged if you put so much of it on! Your eyes are sweet as cakes, but come on! That's not frosting. Ease up a little, keep it subtle, yeah?
Sonya: Mm... Subtle and I were never good friends. Either I'm looking dramatic and unforgettable or I'm not going out.
Leon: That, I can understand. In that case... you see this white rock? It's found in caves, but you can also buy it in port towns. Anyway, you grind this up nice and fine and brush it on top of your makeup and then that stuff stays ON, come hell or high water. Here, I'll break you off a piece of mine. Give it a try tomorrow morning.
Sonya: Oh, my. How generous. I'll need to return the favor somehow...
Leon: Oh, don't worry about it. I'm just glad to have somebody my age to talk makeup with. Let me tell you, those poor girls from the priory don't know the first thing about it.
Sonya: That's no surprise. I did my time in a priory as a kid. Beauty is meant to be shown off, not hidden away in some drab habit.
Leon: Exactly!

B

Sonya: Leon, that face powder you gave me is fantastic. It worked like a charm!
Leon: Obviously! Look at you! The difference is clear.
Sonya: I do wonder, though, how is it you came to be an expert in cosmetics? I don't usually find men among my fellow enthusiasts.
Leon: Well, thankfully my mother didn't mind me digging around in her makeup kit. My father didn't, either.
Sonya: Oh! Don't hear that one as often as I'd like.
Leon: They're great, right? Well, the boys my age weren't.
Sonya: I'd imagine not.
Leon: Perfect excuse for getting really damned good at archery, though! Each boy who gave me guff about my looks or how I talked, I'd challenge him to a test of skill. There's nothing in the world like seeing a bully's tears when he loses to the "little sissy boy". Oh, I could just sweeten my tea with them!
Sonya: Hee hee. You're petty. I like that.
Leon: Incredible motivator, really. I'm sure you've enough men's tears to fill your own teacup.
Sonya: Naturally. It infuriates me that some people can't understand power and skill coexisting with beauty. Aren't the deadliest poisons born from the brightest blooms?
Leon: I couldn't have said it better myself, darling.

A
Leon: Ugh! Stupid, blasted-- That should have hit the mark. This is ridiculous.
Sonya: Woah. Why the scowl, Leon? You look like you bit into the wrong end of a lemon.
Leon: Oh, Sonya. It's nothing. My aim's just been awful today.
Sonya: Mm... A marksman of your skill doesn't just have "bad days". Is something bothering you?
Leon: Whatever. It's nothing.
Sonya: It isn't "nothing" if it's getting to your aim. Come on. I'll buy drinks tonight if you come clean.
Leon: Gods, you do know how to get me to fess up... Listen, it was just some bad customer service. I'll get over it.
Sonya: What kind of "bad customer service" puts you in a mood like THIS?
Leon: Well, I was looking to buy some rouge, and the merchant asks me if it's for my "lady friend". I tell her it's for me, and she looks like I kicked her dog or something, and says it's out of stock. So I ask about the compacts I can see in the back row, and you know what she says? "I'm not interested in selling to deviants." Stupid old bat didn't deserve my money anyway.
Sonya: She sounds hideous. I bet she kept all that rouge to cover the skid marks on her lips from all the horse-plop she was spewing.
Leon: I know, right?! Ugh. I'm just embarrassed it's throwing my aim off so badly. It's normally what I use to show them up.
Sonya: Well, I doubt a crusty old harridan would take you up on the challenge anyway. It'd hardly be a fair match if she did.
Leon: And that's what's pissing me off! When it's some macho meathead, I know exactly how to deal with him. But a little old lady? Then I'm the bad guy, even if she's dead wrong. Ugh. I really should be used to this by now.
Sonya: Now, now, don't say that. She'll get her comeuppance soon enough. In fact... I have a splendid idea.
Leon: Oh?
Sonya: Remember what you said about spite being a powerful motivator? Well... why don't you beat her at her own game? You sold me on that setting powder when we first spoke. I think you'd make a fine merchant yourself.
Leon: Ohhhh. The long con, huh? That sounds... INCREDIBLY petty.
Sonya: Hee hee. It was just a thought. But I have no doubt you'd do a better job than her. So keep your head up, sweetie. Let that guide your arrows today.

Jesse: Hey, pal, you want me to sit for a portrait or somethin'? You can stare at THAT as much as you like.
Clive: My apologies, good sir. It was rude of me to stare. I just... get this strange feeling I've met you before.
Jesse: Wuh-oh, that's not good. Listen, if you've got a sister, I PROMISE I haven't done anything untoward with her. Yeah?
Clive: Heh... I fear if that were the case, she'd already have made a pincushion of you with her lance. ...What is your name, pray tell?
Jesse: The name's Jesse. I'm just your bog-standard jack-of-all-trades. Honestly, I'd be surprised if you HAD heard of me.
Clive: Mm, I'll admit, the name doesn't ring a bell. Perhaps you know of me, then? My name is Clive, knight of Zofia.
Jesse: Hold up. Clive, like, the Deliverance Clive?
Clive: Well, in truth, my fiancee founded it and I no longer lead it--but yes, that's correct.
Jesse: Ulp. How could I NOT know of you? Anyone who can READ has heard of Sir Clive. ...What could a guy like me have done to make a guy like YOU remember my face?
Clive: I'm afraid I have no more clues to that than you do, good sir.
Jesse: Well, uh, I'll let you think on it, then.

Jesse: Besides what you just asked me? Yeah, sure, fire away.
Clive: I apologize if this stirs any sort of ill memories, but... would you happen to know of Lord Taranis of the western lands of Zofia?
Jesse: Uhhh... what's this for?
Clive: He often hosted my father and I. To be quite frank, you bear a striking resemblance to him. Perhaps that's why your face seemed so familiar; I was curious if you had any familial relation to him.
Jesse: ...Well, you know how nobles are. What with the proper wives and the concubines and all that nonsense. Just because he sired me doesn't necessarily mean we had a "familial relation", you dig?
Clive: I see...
Jesse: Yeah, you get it. So you wouldn't have seen me hanging around the manor or anything. Like I said, I'm just a bog-standard talent-for-hire. I never was part of that life.

Jesse: You know, you guys should think about changing your name to the "Inquisition" if you're going to ask so many personal questions.
Clive: Please, I only ask you to alleviate the curiosity that's been eating at me for weeks. You have my word I'll ask no more about this.
Jesse: ...Alright, fine, let's rip the bandage off. Yes, I have seen you around before. You, your old man, and that white-haired boy that followed you everywhere.
Clive: As I thought. I always had fond memories of when your father would host us. But his son was frail and sickly, and rarely stayed to socialize with Fernand and I.
Jesse: Yeah, life was pretty rough for my brother. ...Relatively speaking.
Clive: Aha. That answers my next question, then. Lord Taranis had an incredibly witty, outspoken daughter that was his spitting image. But for the last ten years...
Jesse: Yyyyep, say no more. Man, that was so long ago. It's like hearing about my own ghost. Little creepy, to be honest.
Clive: Right... Well, I apologize if I've pried too much. I just wanted to say... I quite enjoyed the chats we used to have, Jesse. And I'm glad to know you're doing well for yourself, after all.
Jesse: Heh. Well, uh, good to know your heart's in the right place, old pal.

Hey Alm, how's tricks?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hey Tobin. What's up?[AN]
[MidRight]
Between this battle and the last one,[NL]
it's been pretty uneventful, I suppose.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You sure about that, Tobin?[AN]
In our last battle,[NL]
the enemy surrounded you.[AN]
Gray had to come and save you.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
I had everything under control![AN]
I don't need you to sit here and[NL]
tell me how great Gray is[AN]
when I was doing fine enough[NL]
on my own, thank you![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry Tobin, I didn't[NL]
mean to offend you.[AN]
I was just concerned, that's all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, well, whatever.[AN]
Anyway, how's life in the[NL]
Deliverance been treating you?[AN]
Is it everything you'd[NL]
hoped it would be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's far from perfect, but being able[NL]
to go out and see Zofia for real,[AN]
and to serve its people while I'm at it,[NL]
more than makes up for that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Eh. To each his own I suppose.[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
I mean, I don't get how you can just[NL]
up and fight for this country on a whim,[AN]
not knowing whether you're going to get[NL]
anything in return or not.[AN]
Most soldiers only work as hard[NL]
as they do so that they can have[AN]
enough money to sustain themselves[NL]
and their families. I'm no different.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't really have anyone to[NL]
worry about aside from Grandfather.[AN]
[MidRight]
But you need to have something to[NL]
support yourself with, Alm![AN]
This war isn't gonna last forever,[NL]
and you aren't the type to just[AN]
curl up and die once it's done.[NL]
What're you gonna do after that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin, we aren't kids anymore.[AN]
Every day we risk our lives in combat,[NL]
and every day that we're not[AN]
slain on the battlefield is a[NL]
lucky day in my book.[AN]
We're soldiers now, and I'm more[NL]
worried about surviving tomorrow[AN]
than what I'm going to do[NL]
a few years from now.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm, that's not the point.[AN]
If we do make it through this war,[NL]
what then?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I guess we'll cross that bridge[NL]
when we come to it.[AN]

That doesn't look good...[AN]
[MidLeft]
What, this? It's nothing...![AN]
I've had way worse injuries from[NL]
wrangling Sir Mycen's hogs.[AN]
Nothing to worry about.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tobin, your arm is bleeding really bad.
You should go to the back and get it
patched up before it gets any worse.
[MidLeft]
Alm, listen, I'm fine.
Go on back to the front lines.
I'm perfectly fine.
[MidRight]
Tobin, listen to me.
I know you don't want to admit it,
but it's obvious that you're in pain,
and I need you to acknowledge the fact
that if you don't get this treated,
you could die.
[MidLeft]
Would you just buzz off!?
I said I'm fine!
[MidRight]
Tobin, what happens if I let you go[NL]
off with a grisly wound like that[AN]
and it gets you killed?[AN]
What do you expect me to do,[NL]
carry my best friend all the way home[AN]
to Ram Village in a box!?[AN]
And explain to his family that he died[NL]
a stupid death because he was too[AN]
proud to admit that he was injured!?[AN]
If you don't care about how I feel,[NL]
then for the sake of your parents,[AN]
please go and get patched up![AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, alright.
Good goblets, you're paranoid.[AN]
But out of respect for my folks,[NL]
I'll go to the back and get patched up.[AN]
But this isn't over, Alm.[NL]
Be ready, because we're going to duel,[AN]
just like we used to when we were[NL]
in training with Sir Mycen![AN][HalfCloseEyes]
And I'm going to show you just how[NL]
wrong you are about me...![AN]

[ToggleMouthMove]... ......[ToggleMouthMove][AN][ClearFace]

Hey, Alm, I'm sorry about what[NL]
I said to you the other day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
For what you said to me when I was[NL]
holding you down so the cleric[AN]
could tend to your wounds, or[NL]
for what you said to me in our duel?[AN]
[MidRight]
Both.[NL]
The way I talked to you[AN]
and called you names[NL]
was inappropriate of me,[AN]
and I just wanted you to know that[NL]
I didn't mean anything by it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's alright, Tobin. Really.[NL]
I'm not Kliff.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
No, it's not alright.[AN]
You've been nothing but concerned[NL]
about me, and in turn,[AN]
I yelled at you and[NL]
gave you a hard time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin. Listen to me.[AN]
You made a mistake. You apologized.[NL]
Let it go and learn from it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm... I just want to impress you guys.[NL]
I want to impress my siblings.[AN]
When I come home from the war,[AN]
I don't want them to be hearing about[NL]
the exploits of Alm and his soldiers,[AN]
I want them to hear about the[NL]
exploits of Tobin![AN]
How he persevered, and... how[NL]
he did something worth talking about![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But Tobin, you've already done that![NL]
You joined the Deliverance to be able[AN]
to put food on the table for[NL]
your family back home.[AN]
Your efforts are going to put your[NL]
little brothers through school.[AN]
Even if you don't make a big name[NL]
for yourself, you'll always be[AN]
the hero that gave your[NL]
brothers an education.[AN]
And at the end of the day,[NL]
I feel like they'd care about that[AN]
a lot more than they'd care about what[NL]
me and Gray and everyone else has done.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah... Yeah! You're right![AN]
And I have you and Gray[NL]
behind me all the way![AN]
Thanks, Alm![AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't mention it.[NL]
I'm here if you ever need to talk.[AN]

Tobin- (Alright... Breathe... I can do this... I can do this!) Hey, Clair? How goes it? 

Clair- (Focus, Clair... Despite how dashing and marvelous the boy is, he is still a commoner... You've talked to noblemen of much better quality than him and yet you must falter so now?!) Ah, salutations! 

Tobin- (She responded! I don't believe it! Come on, keep it going.) So, Clair, how's the pegasus? Not too bumpy I hope! Eheh... 

Clair- Oh it's simply marvelous, ahaha! Thank you so much for asking. (Marvelous? Thank you for asking? How utterly ridiculous!) 

Tobin- (How was the pegasus? Gah, stupid, stupid! Wait... She's still talking! Good goblets I'm doing better than I thought!) So, I was wondering, if you weren't busy later tonight... Maybe you'd want to go out for tea? We commoners don't have anything like you fancy nobles but the least I could do is treat you with something familiar. 

Clair- (Oh my, how astonishing! My luck is simply superb today!) Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed. I accept! Thank you so very much-!

Tobin- (By the mother...!) Th-then it's a date, then! Woo! Beat that, Gray! 

Clair- Hm? That's odd. I could have sworn I heard somebody speaking just now.



B



Tobin- Clair. 

Clair- Oh, hello, erm, Kliff? 

Tobin- Wha-!? You wound me milady. First you stand me up and now you're pretending like you don't even recognize me? 

Clair- I beg your pardon? 

Tobin- Just the other day I asked you to tea on the battlefield and you accepted! "Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed! I accept! Thank you so very much, Tobin!"

Clair- I- wh- Oh! Dear me! Don't you know that it's rude to pry on a lady like that?! 

Tobin- Wait, now you're accusing me of spying on you? You're heartless! 

Clair- Tobin- it is Tobin? I wasn't speaking to you.

Tobin- Then who were you talking to?! I was standing right behind you! There was nobody else around for miles! 

Clair- What I was doing is none of your business! Now please, put that event out of your mind, before I am humiliated any further! 

Tobin- I- Hang on! Clair wait! Was it something I said? 




A



Clair- *Sigh* You there, boy. I mean Tobin. 

Tobin- Hm... Oh yes hello... Clive was it? 

Clair- I suppose I deserve that. Look, what you saw the other day was merely me talking to myself. That is, practicing. 

Tobin- Why in Mila's name would you be practicing a speech? Milady, the way you speak it beautiful as is. 

Clair- Yes well, I was practicing to talk to... Someone special to me.

Tobin- You mean Alm, right? 

Clair- What? How did- yes it was Alm, but nevermind that. I feel so very awful about that whole ordeal. So as compensation, I was wondering if you'd be interested in having tea with me after this battle. 

Tobin- I thought you had feelings for Alm?

Clair- Alas, he doesn't feel the same I'm afraid. You seem nice enough Tobin.

Tobin- Then... (I've won! Suck on that Gra-) 

Clair- I was hoping you could tell me a bit about your friend Gray. 

Tobin- (Crivens...) Sure. Just name the place, milady.


Celica and Nomah

C (flashback)
Mycen: Well, Celica, we've arrived. The archbishop here at this priory is an old friend of mine. You'll be safe and well-cared for here.
Celica: ...Grandpapa, I'm sorry.
Mycen: What for, Celica?
Celica: I've... I've messed it all up again, haven't I? If only I had joined Conrad in the fire... then everyone in Ram would be safe, wouldn't they?
Mycen: Celica, that's nonsense. You are the only hope for Zofia now.
Celica: But...
Nomah: Now, Mycen, that's a heavy burden to be placing on a child's shoulders, isn't it? Let's have no tearful goodbyes--just a warm welcome instead.
Celica: ...
Mycen: Mm, I suppose you're right, Nomah.
Nomah: Don't look so shy, little one. Is it my beard? You know, I used to not like facial hair, but then it grew on me.
Celica: ...Hee hee... Ha ha ha!
Mycen: Heh. See, Celica? You'll be in good hands. ...Well, I should be going now.
Celica: Oh... Oh, Grandpapa!
Mycen: Oof! Hah, I see that your training has paid off. You've grown strong enough to wind me with your hug.
Celica: Promise that we'll see each other again!
Mycen: Of course, dear child. One day.[ClearFace]
Nomah: So then! If I know that man--and I've known him some thirty years now--he'll keep his word. Now let's get you a proper welcome. What say you we go see what sweets are in the priory cupboards?
Celica: That sounds lovely, Archbishop.
Nomah: Ho ho! Please! Just call me Nomah.

Conversation 1
Conrad: Greetings, Anthiese! You're looking lovely today as usual. Hah! No need to be bashful--I merely speak the truth. Growing up at the villa, you always were my favorite sibling. Small wonder, what with my mother being Rigelian. The other siblings and their mothers always kept me at arm's length. But you and Liprica were always kind to me, and I appreciated it. ...You don't look thrilled. I'm sorry. Is it hard hearing stories of the past? I understand why you'd feel that way, but I've been in hiding ever since. For me, memories of you from the villa are some of my only happy ones.

Conversation 2
Conrad: ...Hmm? You want to hear about the night the villa was burned? My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. When I asked about you, they told me you'd died. I remember running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop till we crossed into Rigel, where I settled in the hamlet. After that, it was long days of sword practice and studying under Halcyon. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Conversation 3
Conrad: Duma Tower isn't far now. How are you feeling, Anthiese? Are you scared? Of course you'd say that. You're as strong as they come. But don't forget you have me and everyone else at your back, okay? I'm not suggesting you don't believe in us. It's more like... Sometimes it's like you're running off ahead without us, and it's...lonely. I don't know. Sorry. I'm not doing a great job of explaining this.

Celica: Conrad, I... I can't express how relieved I am to know that you survived. This whole time, I thought you were gone for good...

Conrad: I felt the same way, Anthiese. At even the first mention of "a girl with a mark on her hand", I was already saddling my horse without hearing the rest. ...Though, I did have a few false starts with that, heh.

Celica: Ahaha. Had I heard word that any of the royal family had not been taken by the flames, I can't say I wouldn't have acted on the same impulse. Though, if the Mother had decided that only one other would survive, I... I am glad it was you.

Conrad: Aww. You were always my favorite sibling too, Anthiese. Everyone else kept my mother and I at arm's length, but not you and yours. ...I was always grateful for that. I was consumed by grief when they told me you'd died. ...Now, it's curiosity that's consuming me, ever since I first set out: how did you manage to escape?

Celica: ...Oh, I... prefer not to dwell on that night if I can help it. Though perhaps, if we both get some closure, we can both move on from it. Why don't you go first?

Conrad: Oh! Of course. My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. For what felt like ages I was running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop until we were well past the Rigel border. 

Celica: ...In truth, I don't remember much detail of the night itself. It was... a lot, and I'd gotten smoke in my lungs. But a royal knight named Sir Mycen took me and fled to a small village.

Conrad: I guess we ended up with a pretty similar fate. My mother had known the Sage Halcyon when she still lived there, so I settled in his little village as well. 

Celica: The places I grew up in were small, but I had friends in both, thankfully. You've met some of mine, so I'm curious to know about yours.

Conrad: ...Oh, I, um... never outgrew my shyness, unfortunately. Most of the few happy memories I do have were of you and the villa. Not that it was a bad life with Halcyon, not at all! It was long days of sword practice and studying. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. 

Celica: Hee hee. Quite the downgrade, for a royal son.

Conrad: Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Celica: Oh! Hello, Conrad.

Masked Knight: Anthiese? Is that you, Sister?

Celica: Well, yes, of course, but... Hee hee...

Conrad: Huh? What's so funny?

Celica: S-sorry, it's just... I know in my head it's you, but you just look so INTENSE with that mask on! It's like I have two different brothers.

Conrad: Aw, whaaat? C'mon! I'm the only brother you need!

Celica: Hee hee. Yes, you're right. One is MORE than enough.

Celica: Aww... I was only teasing, Conrad. Please don't take it to heart.

Conrad: Even if you didn't mean it seriously, it's serious to me.

Celica: Oh, come on, Brother, don't be like that!

Conrad: Anthiese!

Celica: Oh! I didn't know you were so close by.

Conrad: Heh heh. Kinda funny how we keep running into each other like this, huh?

Celica: This is hardly the time for idle chit-chat, Conrad. Everyone else is fighting their hardest, and we need to do the same. Why can't you be as sharp and dashing as when you were the masked knight?

Conrad: Wait, dashing? Daaaashing? Er, one second!

Masked Knight: Any who dare lay a hand on my sister shall feel the sting of my blade!

Celica: Hee hee! Yes! THAT'S the spirit!

Saber: Ah, that hits the spot. Nothing takes the edge off like a bit of drink. It's a good thing this flask fits flush against my armor.
Sonya: You sure that's a good idea on the battlefield, big guy? I've heard tell of your skill with the blade, but I worry you'll put another eye out with that thing if you're not careful.
Saber: Heh. If I couldn't hold this thing as well as I hold my liquor, I'd have been out of a job years ago.
Sonya: I'm sure your employer would love to hear about what you're drinking while on her dime.
Saber: You wouldn't dare.
Sonya: Mmm, I suppose my silence can be bought for the right price. Say, the rest of that flask?
Saber: You sure? This stuff's like as not to knock a delicate lady like yourself out cold.
Sonya: It's unwise to underestimate me, sweetheart. Hand it over. ...Ooh! That certainly burns. I'd best save the rest of this for later.
Saber: Well, well. You're tougher than I thought. Seems I've gotten too used to protecting precious priestesses to think a witch would be able to keep up with me.
Sonya: Next tavern we stop at, let's put that to the test, shall we? Hee hee.

Saber: Urgh.
Sonya: Hee hee. What's wrong, old man? Did you drink something your stomach didn't agree with?
Saber: Listen, lady, enjoy your twenties while you still can. Once you hit thirty, the hangovers hit like a runaway bull. That Rigelian stuff you gave me was somethin' else.
Sonya: I'm surprised you could tell. It's hard to get hold of down here. The berries it's made from only grow in the Rigelian tundra. You wouldn't know it unless you'd spent some serious time there.
Saber: Yeah, well, mercs get around. What's it to you?
Sonya: It takes one to know one, is all. So you're Rigelian, too.
Saber: ...Guess the jig's up. Yeah, I am, but that was years ago. That life of mine is over. I've no more allegiance to it.
Sonya: Nor do I. The pursuit of strength isn't limited to Rigel alone. I take on whatever job will make me stronger. ...Regardless of employer.
Saber: So that's how a witch like you ended up working for Grieth, eh? Must be some goal, if it's got you casting your lot in with lowlifes like him.
Sonya: I've my reasons. As I'm sure you do. It's not usually the domain of stable, well-adjusted folk to take on the lonely life of a mercenary.
Saber: You got that right. ...Heh. Looks like we'd make a pretty good team, you and I.
Sonya: How about we prove that by making some cultists regret their life choices, hmm?
Saber: Say no more.

//they talk about mathilda idk

Clive:
Fernand, let me hear your thoughts on something. It's about the battalion. How do you judge their skill?
Fernand:
Certainly. I'd say I'm not disappointed. I see no shirking of duty, and no one's missed practice by my count.
Clive:
Would you say anyone in particular stands out in their performance?
Fernand:
Well, it should be obvious no one could ever match yours, if that's what you're asking. Though I suppose the lady one's doing fairly well for herself.
Clive:
That Mathilda is a force to be reckoned with. She's easily more skilled than myself, even. Yet even with such strength, she's still as lovely as a rose.
Fernand:
If you say so.
Clive:
Hah! I'd expect more enthusiasm from you. The other knights are all agog at her beauty.
Fernand:
She's, er... not exactly to my tastes. I prefer a bit more... meat on the bones, so to speak. Besides, a woman her age would be better served looking for a husband rather than a target for her weapon.
Clive:
Fernand! That's a line too far. As I recall, your father's incessantly been asking after your own marital prospects of late. Don't you think she'd be just as tired as you are of hearing such?
Fernand: 
Urgh. Yes, you're right. He's gone as far as to threaten to choose a bride for me if I don't start searching for my own in earnest.
Clive:
Don't sound so down, Fernand. If you'd just be a bit more outgoing, I know you'd have no trouble finding a suitable woman to court.
Fernand:
...Clive, that's the PROBLEM. I can't exactly call it "having trouble finding" when I've no interest in searching in the first place. It's no easy task to feign interest when there's someone in your heart already.
Clive:
Oh?! Which lucky maiden has fetched Fernand's heart? Why don't you introduce her to me?
Fernand:
I-- I don't have time to stand around gossiping like hens. I must go tend to the new recruits. Farewell.[ClearFace]
Clive:
Oh, now my interest is well and truly piqued. Hmm... "meat on the bones", he said? Perhaps he likes them plump...

Clive:
How do you fare today, Fernand...?
Fernand:
...Surviving, I suppose.
Clive:
Well, it's certainly better than the alternative, at least. I hope I can give you no cause to doubt that I will be by your side through all of this. You have my word.
Fernand:
I appreciate it... truly. Your mere presence... alleviates the burden on my heart.
Clive:
You will always be like family to both Clair and myself. I know it's not enough to fill the void, but... we are here for you.
Fernand:
...Please, Clive. Would you stay for just a little longer?
Clive:
Of course.
Fernand:
...Do you remember that night at the ball five years ago when we danced together?
Clive:
How could I not remember? You were the happiest I'd ever seen you.
Fernand:
It's no coincidence that my father suddenly remarried shortly after. My half-sister... She was only four years old... She was his hope.
Clive:
Of course--but you, a proud and accomplished knight, were his hope as well. What are you saying, Fernand?
Fernand:
...With their passing, our proud and ancient bloodline will die with me. There are no other heirs to it left alive, and I am... nothing more than a broken branch on our family tree.
Clive:
Don't say that, Fernand. Hope is not lost for you yet. You are a strong, handsome, refined knight, more than you even know. The ladies will flock to you in due time. Someday, you'll--
Fernand:
No, Clive. I will not. I was not made like you. I was not made to love a woman. ...My father realized it, that very night. The abject disappointment that veiled his gaze is burnt forever into my mind.
Clive:
...Oh, Fernand, I--I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you into--
Mathilda (offscreen):
Clive! Oh, where has he gone now? Clive?
Fernand:
...Your lady is calling for you. You should go to her.
Clive:
But, Fernand--
Fernand:
Just... go. Before I change my mind. Now go!
