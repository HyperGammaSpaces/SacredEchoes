Conrad: Greetings, Anthiese! You're looking lovely today as usual. Hah! No need to be bashful--I merely speak the truth. Growing up at the villa, you always were my favorite sibling. Small wonder, what with my mother being Rigelian. The other siblings and their mothers always kept me at arm's length. But you and Liprica were always kind to me, and I appreciated it. ...You don't look thrilled. I'm sorry. Is it hard hearing stories of the past? I understand why you'd feel that way, but I've been in hiding ever since. For me, memories of you from the villa are some of my only happy ones.

Conversation 2
Conrad: ...Hmm? You want to hear about the night the villa was burned? My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. When I asked about you, they told me you'd died. I remember running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop till we crossed into Rigel, where I settled in the hamlet. After that, it was long days of sword practice and studying under Halcyon. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Conversation 3
Conrad: Duma Tower isn't far now. How are you feeling, Anthiese? Are you scared? Of course you'd say that. You're as strong as they come. But don't forget you have me and everyone else at your back, okay? I'm not suggesting you don't believe in us. It's more like... Sometimes it's like you're running off ahead without us, and it's...lonely. I don't know. Sorry. I'm not doing a great job of explaining this.

Celica: Oh! Hello, Conrad.

Masked Knight: Anthiese? Is that you, Sister?

Celica: Well, yes, of course, but... Hee hee...

Conrad: Huh? What's so funny?

Celica: S-sorry, it's just... I know in my head it's you, but you just look so INTENSE with that mask on! It's like I have two different brothers.

Conrad: Aw, whaaat? C'mon! I'm the only brother you need!

Celica: Hee hee. Yes, you're right. One is MORE than enough.

Celica: Aww... I was only teasing, Conrad. Please don't take it to heart.

Conrad: Even if you didn't mean it seriously, it's serious to me.

Celica: Oh, come on, Brother, don't be like that!

Conrad: Anthiese!

Celica: Oh! I didn't know you were so close by.

Conrad: Heh heh. Kinda funny how we keep running into each other like this, huh?

Celica: This is hardly the time for idle chit-chat, Conrad. Everyone else is fighting their hardest, and we need to do the same. Why can't you be as sharp and dashing as when you were the masked knight?

Conrad: Wait, dashing? Daaaashing? Er, one second!

Masked Knight: Any who dare lay a hand on my sister shall feel the sting of my blade!

Celica: Hee hee! Yes! THAT'S the spirit!

Celica: ...Grandpapa, I'm sorry.
Mycen: What for, Celica?
Celica: I've... I've messed it all up again, haven't I? If only I had joined Conrad in the fire... then everyone in Ram would be safe, wouldn't they?

Nomah: Don't look so shy, little one. Is it my beard? You know, I used to not like facial hair, but then it grew on me.

Celica: Oh... Oh, Grandpapa!
Mycen: Oof! Hah, I see that your training has paid off. You've grown strong enough to wind me with your hug.
Celica: Promise that we'll see each other again!
Mycen: Of course, dear child. One day.[ClearFace]
Nomah: So then! If I know that man--and I've known him some thirty years now--he'll keep his word. Now let's get you a proper welcome. What say you we go see what sweets are in the priory cupboards?

Tobin- (Alright... Breathe... I can do this... I can do this!) Hey, Clair? How goes it? 

Clair- (Focus, Clair... Despite how dashing and marvelous the boy is, he is still a commoner... You've talked to noblemen of much better quality than him and yet you must falter so now?!) Ah, salutations! 

Tobin- (She responded! I don't believe it! Come on, keep it going.) So, Clair, how's the pegasus? Not too bumpy I hope! Eheh... 

Clair- Oh it's simply marvelous, ahaha! Thank you so much for asking. (Marvelous? Thank you for asking? How utterly ridiculous!) 

Tobin- (How was the pegasus? Gah, stupid, stupid! Wait... She's still talking! Good goblets I'm doing better than I thought!) So, I was wondering, if you weren't busy later tonight... Maybe you'd want to go out for tea? We commoners don't have anything like you fancy nobles but the least I could do is treat you with something familiar. 

Clair- (Oh my, how astonishing! My luck is simply superb today!) Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed. I accept! Thank you so very much-!

Tobin- (By the mother...!) Th-then it's a date, then! Woo! Beat that, Gray! 

Clair- Hm? That's odd. I could have sworn I heard somebody speaking just now.

Tobin- Clair. 

Clair- Oh, hello, erm, Kliff? 

Tobin- Wha-!? You wound me milady. First you stand me up and now you're pretending like you don't even recognize me? 

Clair- I beg your pardon? 

Tobin- Just the other day I asked you to tea on the battlefield and you accepted! "Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed! I accept! Thank you so very much, Tobin!"

Clair- I- wh- Oh! Dear me! Don't you know that it's rude to pry on a lady like that?! 

Tobin- Wait, now you're accusing me of spying on you? You're heartless! 

Clair- Tobin- it is Tobin? I wasn't speaking to you.

Tobin- Then who were you talking to?! I was standing right behind you! There was nobody else around for miles! 

Clair- What I was doing is none of your business! Now please, put that event out of your mind, before I am humiliated any further! 

Tobin- I- Hang on! Clair wait! Was it something I said? 




A



Clair- *Sigh* You there, boy. I mean Tobin. 

Tobin- Hm... Oh yes hello... Clive was it? 

Clair- I suppose I deserve that. Look, what you saw the other day was merely me talking to myself. That is, practicing. 

Tobin- Why in Mila's name would you be practicing a speech? Milady, the way you speak it beautiful as is. 

Clair- Yes well, I was practicing to talk to... Someone special to me.

Tobin- You mean Alm, right? 

Clair- What? How did- yes it was Alm, but nevermind that. I feel so very awful about that whole ordeal. So as compensation, I was wondering if you'd be interested in having tea with me after this battle. 

Tobin- I thought you had feelings for Alm?

Clair- Alas, he doesn't feel the same I'm afraid. You seem nice enough Tobin.

Tobin- Then... (I've won! Suck on that Gra-) 

Clair- I was hoping you could tell me a bit about your friend Gray. 

Tobin- (Crivens...) Sure. Just name the place, milady.

Probably some kind of "ur dad is sick/died a few years back and the estate is supposed to be passed to the eldest child, oddly enough, daughter, but no one can fucking find her" or some shit
I feel like, moving the b support to c's place, moving all important bits from a to b and then using the remaining space in a and b to resolve some noble side thing with jesse's family would. Make sense
Like what im saying is the c support can be cut/frankensteined so that jesse's friendship with clive and noble backstory has room to flesh out

Clive: ...
Jesse: Hey, pal, you want me to sit for a portrait or somethin'? You can stare at THAT as much as you like.
Clive: Er... I apologize if this stirs any sort of ill memory, but... would you happen to know of Lord Taranis of the western lands of Zofia?
Jesse: Well, that's oddly specific. Yeah, I guess I've heard the name in passing. Why, what of it?
Clive: To be quite frank, you bear a striking resemblance to him. I was curious if you had any familial relation.
Jesse: Uhhh... what's this for?
Clive: My father has long considered him a friend, but recently he's taken ill. He sent word to my father about an unresolved issue of inheritance, and asked our help in settling it.
Jesse: Gee, that sounds like a knot I'm glad to not be tied up in.
Clive: ...Would that it were so simple. There is a very large estate at stake in the matter. And I assure you I'm not normally one to pry so, but... the resemblance is simply too uncanny to ignore. Please excuse my rude behavior, Jesse, but I gave my word. I would be remiss not to question a potential lead.
Jesse: ...Well, you know how nobles are. When they can get away with it, they'll sow their wild oats wherever they damn well please. That's what wills are for, yeah? A bit of shared blood on its own doesn't mean a thing to folks like that.
Clive: I... see. I'm afraid I don't know the full story, but I suspect his illness is dire enough to make him reconsider--
Jesse: Listen, that's big if true, but I'm just a wandering rogue. I'm not meant to be part of that kind of life. Never was, you dig? That's probably not the answer you were looking for, but hey, it's closure, I guess.
Clive: Understood. Well, thank you for putting the question to rest. I've at least got word to send, now.

## CliveJesse_B

Clive: Jesse. If I may?
Jesse: What can I do you for, chief?
Clive: I hate to press the matter further, but I received an odd reply about the inheritance matter.
Jesse: Wuh-oh. That's not good. What'd it say?
Clive: Well, er... he wrote, "I have no son, save for the one looking after this very manor. His portion of the estate has been settled."
Jesse: Typical. Well, that's that, then?
Clive: ...I'm afraid it's left me with more questions than answers. In the next paragraph, he wrote, "The matter which remains unresolved is that of my eldest child, his sister, who deserted us some ten years ago."
Jesse: Yeah, that's odd all right, considering he didn't have a daughter, either.
Clive: You're sure of this...? I recall him hosting my father and I at his summer villa once yearly, from when I was very young. While our fathers discussed land affairs, Fernand and I were left to play with the lord's son and daughter.
Jesse: Hey, I just told you, pal, he didn't have a--
Clive: His son was sickly, much younger, and lacked the constitution for the sort of mischief Fernand and I got into in those days. But his daughter, on the other hand--that child could roughhouse with the best of us. She had a wit like a rapier and a sword arm to match. Our faces all ached with mirth by the time the bonfire was doused.
Jesse: ...That, uh, sure does sound like somebody hard to forget about.
Clive: Yet behind that easygoing smile was a fierce independence, which grew only bolder when the nursemaids demanded she keep silent and start acting like a lady. She was every bit as stubborn as her father, and not even his own thunderous admonishments could make her back down.
Jesse: I mean, you don't get billed as the Iron Fist of the West for being a nice guy.
Clive: I valued that friendship more and more with each year we summered there. And then, perhaps ten years ago, I learned that our last visit together had already passed. When I asked Lord Taranis where she was... Well, it was just as you said. He had no daughter.
Jesse: ...Well, he's right. Maybe not in the way he meant to be, but he's not wrong.
Clive: ...Mm. Ever since then, I wondered what might have become of my childhood friend. I wondered if we'd ever meet again. There were far too many things I wished I'd had a chance to say to... him.
Jesse: Heh. I gotta say, those visits are some of the only good memories I've got of that place.
Clive: I apologize if I've brought up anything painful, Jesse. This inheritance business has been a bit of an ordeal.
Jesse: Hey, don't sweat it. Why don't you make it up to me with a nice tankard of ale? If you ask me, there's no better way to start catching up with an old pal.
Clive: Oof! Ha ha... Those pats on the back still knock the wind out of me. It's a plan, then.

Jesse: Tell him to eat shit and fall off his horse. Also, that the jewels go to whoever my brother marries.


Jesse: You know, you guys should think about changing your name to the "Inquisition" if you're going to ask so many personal questions.

Jesse: Yyyyep, say no more. Man, that was so long ago. It's like hearing about my own ghost. Little creepy, to be honest.

//they talk about mathilda idk

Clive:
Fernand, let me hear your thoughts on something. It's about the battalion. How do you judge their skill?
Fernand:
Certainly. I'd say I'm not disappointed. I see no shirking of duty, and no one's missed practice by my count.
Clive:
Would you say anyone in particular stands out in their performance?
Fernand:
Well, it should be obvious no one could ever match yours, if that's what you're asking. Though I suppose the lady one's doing fairly well for herself.
Clive:
That Mathilda is a force to be reckoned with. She's easily more skilled than myself, even. Yet even with such strength, she's still as lovely as a rose.
Fernand:
If you say so.
Clive:
Hah! I'd expect more enthusiasm from you. The other knights are all agog at her beauty.
Fernand:
She's, er... not exactly to my tastes. I prefer a bit more... meat on the bones, so to speak. Besides, a woman her age would be better served looking for a husband rather than a target for her weapon.
Clive:
Fernand! That's a line too far. As I recall, your father's incessantly been asking after your own marital prospects of late. Don't you think she'd be just as tired as you are of hearing such?
Fernand: 
Urgh. Yes, you're right. He's gone as far as to threaten to choose a bride for me if I don't start searching for my own in earnest.
Clive:
Don't sound so down, Fernand. If you'd just be a bit more outgoing, I know you'd have no trouble finding a suitable woman to court.
Fernand:
...Clive, that's the PROBLEM. I can't exactly call it "having trouble finding" when I've no interest in searching in the first place. It's no easy task to feign interest when there's someone in your heart already.
Clive:
Oh?! Which lucky maiden has fetched Fernand's heart? Why don't you introduce her to me?
Fernand:
I-- I don't have time to stand around gossiping like hens. I must go tend to the new recruits. Farewell.[ClearFace]
Clive:
Oh, now my interest is well and truly piqued. Hmm... "meat on the bones", he said? Perhaps he likes them plump...

Clive:
How do you fare today, Fernand...?
Fernand:
...Surviving, I suppose.
Clive:
Well, it's certainly better than the alternative, at least. I hope I can give you no cause to doubt that I will be by your side through all of this. You have my word.
Fernand:
I appreciate it... truly. Your mere presence... alleviates the burden on my heart.

You will always be like family to both Clair and myself. I know it's not enough to fill the void, but... we are here for you.

Clive:
Of course.
Fernand:
...Do you remember that night at the ball five years ago when we danced together?
Clive:
How could I not remember? You were the happiest I'd ever seen you.
Fernand:
It's no coincidence that my father suddenly remarried shortly after. My half-sister... She was only four years old... She was his hope.
Clive:
Of course--but you, a proud and accomplished knight, were his hope as well. What are you saying, Fernand?
Fernand:
...With their passing, our proud and ancient bloodline will die with me. There are no other heirs to it left alive, and I am... nothing more than a broken branch on our family tree.
Clive:
Don't say that, Fernand. Hope is not lost for you yet. You are a strong, handsome, refined knight, more than you even know. The ladies will flock to you in due time. Someday, you'll--
Fernand:
No, Clive. I will not. I was not made like you. I was not made to love a woman. ...My father realized it, that very night. The abject disappointment that veiled his gaze is burnt forever into my mind.
Clive:
...Oh, Fernand, I--I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you into--
Mathilda (offscreen):
Clive! Oh, where has he gone now? Clive?
Fernand:
...Your lady is calling for you. You should go to her.
Clive:
But, Fernand--
Fernand:
Just... go. Before I change my mind. Now go!

[MidRight]
Oh, really? And what about you?[AN]
You've been clinging to my brother[NL]
since before I was born, Fernand.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Is there anything YOU should be[NL]
telling me, hmmmmm?[.4] After all,[AN]
you aren't exactly scrambling to[NL]
find a pretty maid of your own.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
W-[.4]We are not talking about me![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha![.4] Look at you, so easily shaken![NL]
I was merely teasing.[AN]
Besides, Clive already told me[NL]
what your true weakness is.[AN]
He claims you prefer your ladies[NL]
like your oranges:[.4] full and ripe.[AN]
Now which of the knights' eligible[NL]
ladies is juicy enough for you?[.4] Hmm...[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I am going to find your brother[NL]
and bury him in a very deep hole...[AN][OpenEyes]
Touch[0xE9], Clair.[.4] I'm glad you[NL]
had your fun. Now farewell![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
What? [MoveMidLeft]Wait, come back here![NL]
You can't run from your destiny![AN]

[MidRight]
Lady Mathilda.[NL]
Did you need something?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am looking for Clive.[AN]
[MidRight]
We're not attached at[NL]
the hip, you know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, but you ARE like brothers.[AN]
Perhaps I just think of you[NL]
as a single entity. Ha ha.[AN]
In any case, pray forgive me[NL]
if I upset you.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm not upset.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Are you certain? It seems[NL]
every time I try to talk to you,[AN]
you refuse to look me in the eye.[AN]
If I did something wrong, tell me.[NL]
I don't want you to hate me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hate you? Of course not.[NL]
But all you ever ask about is Clive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh[Beat]right.[AN]
I can see how that would[NL]
be grating. It's just...[AN]
Well, your stories about Clive are[NL]
far more interesting than[NL]
the ones he tells.[AN]
[MidRight]
For true?[AN]
I can't imagine what I could tell you[NL]
that he hasn't already.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, if you only knew.[AN]
I adore talking with him, but[Beat][NL]
Well, he doesn't know how to loosen up.[AN]
He's very self-conscious.[AN]
I want to hear about his misadventures,[NL]
not just what he thinks I want to hear.[AN]
[MidRight]
So he never told you about sneaking[NL]
into the mess hall before lunch?[AN]
Or the story of licking the[NL]
cream off the cake?[AN]
Surely he's told you about trying[NL]
to ride those sheep?![AN]
He scared them so much,[AN]
they fled the pen and[NL]
rampaged across the village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha ha! I fear he neglected to[NL]
mention any of those escapades.[AN]
[MidRight]
He may look all gallant and composed,[NL]
but let me tell you...[AN]
Clive can be quite the ruffian when[NL]
no one is looking.[AN]
He makes me look like a saint.[NL]
I suggest you be careful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your suggestion is noted.[AN]
This is why I like talking[NL]
to you, Fernand.[AN]
...But it's not the only reason.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course I enjoy hearing about Clive.[AN]
But I also enjoy watching you[NL]
as you tell the stories.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Is that so?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your eyes light up when you[NL]
talk about him.[AN]
I can tell how happy it was for[NL]
the two of you to grow up together.[AN]
It's a type of affection that[NL]
he and I will never have.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, I wouldn't say that...[AN]
[MidLeft]
All I know is that I'd love to see[NL]
the site of Clive's sheep rampage,[AN]
or visit the kitchen where you[NL]
defrocked that poor cake.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'd be happy to take you.[NL]
And I'm not just saying that.[AN]
We can all go together:[NL]
you, me, and Clive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Fernand.[NL]
I would love that.[AN]

You were awfully chipper during[NL]
this morning's roundtable.[AN]
What's put such a glow upon[NL]
your visage today, Mathilda?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh--this? Well...[NL]
why don't you see for yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat][NL][ToggleSmile]
Oh.[AN]
That's a[Beat][NL]
very fine ring.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Clive asked for my hand in marriage[NL]
just the other night.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]D-Did he, now.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, he did. It took me[NL]
entirely by surprise![AN]
He'd floated the idea before,[NL]
but I thought he wished to wait[AN]
for the Deliverance to be in a[NL]
better position before[AN]
he actually asked.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
This is[Beat] the first I've heard[NL]
of such a plan.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Really, now?[AN]
He must've seriously been wanting[NL]
this to be a surprise![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Y-Yes, well...[NL][CloseEyes]
he usually tells me everything.[AN][OpenEyes]
Surprise or not.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, are you all right?[NL]
You look oddly pale.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry.[NL]
This is joyous news, I know.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
I suppose I'm just[Beat][NL]
not feeling well, is all.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, you know this won't change[NL]
anything between the three of us.[AN]
If that's what's on your mind--[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Oh, I think enough has[NL]
changed already.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Is it because Clive didn't speak[NL]
a word of this to you?[AN]
I assure you--it isn't as if[NL]
you'll be left out.[AN]
In fact, Clive insisted that[NL]
you'd be his best man--[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Is that supposed to be some sort[NL]
of consolation prize?[AN]
Do I look like the type of man[NL]
who settles for second place?![AN]
[MidRight]
Second place--? Fernand,[NL]
what's this all of a sudden?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you even realize what you've[NL]
taken from me today, you callous--[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
--Now hold a moment, if this is how[NL]
you speak to the woman you claim[AN]
to hold feelings for,[NL]
then I believe I made the right--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
--Oh, you REALLY think this is[NL]
about YOU? What arrogance![AN]
There's only one man worthy of[NL]
my heart, and that's--[AN]
[Beat][NL]
That's...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat][CloseEyes] I've said too much already.[NL]
I must excuse myself.[AN][ClearFace]

Fernand, wait--[AN]
