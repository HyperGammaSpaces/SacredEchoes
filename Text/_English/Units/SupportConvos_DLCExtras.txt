Conrad: Greetings, Anthiese! You're looking lovely today as usual. Hah! No need to be bashful--I merely speak the truth. Growing up at the villa, you always were my favorite sibling. Small wonder, what with my mother being Rigelian. The other siblings and their mothers always kept me at arm's length. But you and Liprica were always kind to me, and I appreciated it. ...You don't look thrilled. I'm sorry. Is it hard hearing stories of the past? I understand why you'd feel that way, but I've been in hiding ever since. For me, memories of you from the villa are some of my only happy ones.

Conversation 2
Conrad: ...Hmm? You want to hear about the night the villa was burned? My mother's handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. When I asked about you, they told me you'd died. I remember running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn't stop till we crossed into Rigel, where I settled in the hamlet. After that, it was long days of sword practice and studying under Halcyon. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. Heh. I didn't mind. He was hiding me, and it's not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I'll whip up something tasty!

Conversation 3
Conrad: Duma Tower isn't far now. How are you feeling, Anthiese? Are you scared? Of course you'd say that. You're as strong as they come. But don't forget you have me and everyone else at your back, okay? I'm not suggesting you don't believe in us. It's more like... Sometimes it's like you're running off ahead without us, and it's...lonely. I don't know. Sorry. I'm not doing a great job of explaining this.

Celica: Oh! Hello, Conrad.

Masked Knight: Anthiese? Is that you, Sister?

Celica: Well, yes, of course, but... Hee hee...

Conrad: Huh? What's so funny?

Celica: S-sorry, it's just... I know in my head it's you, but you just look so INTENSE with that mask on! It's like I have two different brothers.

Conrad: Aw, whaaat? C'mon! I'm the only brother you need!

Celica: Hee hee. Yes, you're right. One is MORE than enough.

Celica: Aww... I was only teasing, Conrad. Please don't take it to heart.

Conrad: Even if you didn't mean it seriously, it's serious to me.

Celica: Oh, come on, Brother, don't be like that!

Conrad: Anthiese!

Celica: Oh! I didn't know you were so close by.

Conrad: Heh heh. Kinda funny how we keep running into each other like this, huh?

Celica: This is hardly the time for idle chit-chat, Conrad. Everyone else is fighting their hardest, and we need to do the same. Why can't you be as sharp and dashing as when you were the masked knight?

Conrad: Wait, dashing? Daaaashing? Er, one second!

Masked Knight: Any who dare lay a hand on my sister shall feel the sting of my blade!

Celica: Hee hee! Yes! THAT'S the spirit!

Mycen: Well, Celica, we've arrived. The archbishop here at this priory is an old friend of mine. You'll be safe and well-cared for here.
Celica: ...Grandpapa, I'm sorry.
Mycen: What for, Celica?
Celica: I've... I've messed it all up again, haven't I? If only I had joined Conrad in the fire... then everyone in Ram would be safe, wouldn't they?
Mycen: Celica, that's nonsense. You are the only hope for Zofia now.
Celica: But...
Nomah: Now, Mycen, that's a heavy burden to be placing on a child's shoulders, isn't it? Let's have no tearful goodbyes--just a warm welcome instead.
Celica: ...
Mycen: Mm, I suppose you're right, Nomah.
Nomah: Don't look so shy, little one. Is it my beard? You know, I used to not like facial hair, but then it grew on me.
Celica: ...Hee hee... Ha ha ha!
Mycen: Heh. See, Celica? You'll be in good hands. ...Well, I should be going now.
Celica: Oh... Oh, Grandpapa!
Mycen: Oof! Hah, I see that your training has paid off. You've grown strong enough to wind me with your hug.
Celica: Promise that we'll see each other again!
Mycen: Of course, dear child. One day.[ClearFace]
Nomah: So then! If I know that man--and I've known him some thirty years now--he'll keep his word. Now let's get you a proper welcome. What say you we go see what sweets are in the priory cupboards?

[MidRight][LoadConrad]
I-[.4] I am unharmed, no thanks to your ambush. Do you always walk so deadly silent?[AN]
[Left]
Sorry. Force of habit.
Didn't mean to make you choke on your little snack there.
[MidRight]
And yet, given your prior hostility, I'm to trust you so easily...?
[Left]
Well, that's exactly what I came here to apologize for.
[MidRight]
...Is that so?
[Left]
I had the wrong idea about you, kid. I didn't realize you were her brother. ...The princess, I mean.
[MidRight]
Then you were convinced of my disguise
at least as much as I was convinced
of the threat of you quite literally
snapping my fingers off.
I suppose that counts for something.
[Left]
I think you're overselling that little mask of yours, buddy.
But, I pushed you around like that in the interest of keeping Celica safe.
I see now that you've got the same goal as I do. So, I just wanted to make it clear that I'm out of threats and I don't have any more reason to hold a grudge. Now let me buy you a beer to make it up to you.
[MidRight]
I... thank you for your most generous offer, good sir, but I don't partake.
[Left]
Yeah? All right, then what DO you "partake"?
Name your price.
[MidRight]
Right, then... There's a fragrant herb that only grows in the southern parts of Zofia, known as origanum. I'd be quite impressed if you were able to procure me some. Perhaps impressed enough to be convinced of your sincerity.
[Left]
An odd request. But sure, I'll get you your herb. And I'll get it to you soon. That's a promise.[AN][ClearFace]

Wow, Saber, I'm impressed. You managed to procure me some truly excellent origanum.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah? Well, I know some guys. Selling your sword to spice merchants gets you some unexpected payoffs.
[MidRight]
It seems your client knows their trade. Here--taste this dish. It's white fish, grilled in a sauce made with that herb.
[MidLeft]
Well, I think I've had enough fish in the past few months to feed a whale, but all right. ...Huh. That's good. REAL good. Where'd this come from?
[MidRight]
Oh, well, I cooked it myself, for Anthiese. It was one of her favorite dishes when we were children. But I made a bit too much for just the two of us.
[MidLeft]
You cook? Huh. I don't think I've ever met a man who cooks this well. Especially not another Rigelian.
[MidRight]
...Y-Yes, well, do you take issue with that?
[MidLeft]
What? No. You're a fantastic cook. I'm just surprised you stuck with it long enough to get good. Me, I got tired of being told cooking was "women's work" and gave it up.
[MidRight]
Ha... My master Halcyon said the same thing. When we first started weapons training, I couldn't keep up. He told me, "If you can't train like a man, then you're going back to the house and doing woman's work instead." It wasn't the punishment he thought it would be--in fact, I far preferred the spoon over the spear.
[MidLeft]
Typical Rigelian childhood, then. All kinds of silly rules for who does what. Doesn't stop after you get drafted into the army, either.
[MidRight]
I shudder to think of it.
[MidLeft]
Well, that life's behind me. Nothing's stopping me from messing around in the kitchen now but my own lack of skill. Tell ya what--if you don't mind showing me a few tricks, I'll put in another order with my spice guy for whatever you need. Deal?
[MidRight]
That sounds agreeable enough to me!

//they talk about mathilda idk

Clive:
Fernand, let me hear your thoughts on something. It's about the battalion. How do you judge their skill?
Fernand:
Certainly. I'd say I'm not disappointed. I see no shirking of duty, and no one's missed practice by my count.
Clive:
Would you say anyone in particular stands out in their performance?
Fernand:
Well, it should be obvious no one could ever match yours, if that's what you're asking. Though I suppose the lady one's doing fairly well for herself.
Clive:
That Mathilda is a force to be reckoned with. She's easily more skilled than myself, even. Yet even with such strength, she's still as lovely as a rose.
Fernand:
If you say so.
Clive:
Hah! I'd expect more enthusiasm from you. The other knights are all agog at her beauty.
Fernand:
She's, er... not exactly to my tastes. I prefer a bit more... meat on the bones, so to speak. Besides, a woman her age would be better served looking for a husband rather than a target for her weapon.
Clive:
Fernand! That's a line too far. As I recall, your father's incessantly been asking after your own marital prospects of late. Don't you think she'd be just as tired as you are of hearing such?
Fernand: 
Urgh. Yes, you're right. He's gone as far as to threaten to choose a bride for me if I don't start searching for my own in earnest.
Clive:
Don't sound so down, Fernand. If you'd just be a bit more outgoing, I know you'd have no trouble finding a suitable woman to court.
Fernand:
...Clive, that's the PROBLEM. I can't exactly call it "having trouble finding" when I've no interest in searching in the first place. It's no easy task to feign interest when there's someone in your heart already.
Clive:
Oh?! Which lucky maiden has fetched Fernand's heart? Why don't you introduce her to me?
Fernand:
I-- I don't have time to stand around gossiping like hens. I must go tend to the new recruits. Farewell.[ClearFace]
Clive:
Oh, now my interest is well and truly piqued. Hmm... "meat on the bones", he said? Perhaps he likes them plump...

Clive:
How do you fare today, Fernand...?
Fernand:
...Surviving, I suppose.
Clive:
Well, it's certainly better than the alternative, at least. I hope I can give you no cause to doubt that I will be by your side through all of this. You have my word.
Fernand:
I appreciate it... truly. Your mere presence... alleviates the burden on my heart.
Clive:
You will always be like family to both Clair and myself. I know it's not enough to fill the void, but... we are here for you.
Fernand:
...Please, Clive. Would you stay for just a little longer?
Clive:
Of course.
Fernand:
...Do you remember that night at the ball five years ago when we danced together?
Clive:
How could I not remember? You were the happiest I'd ever seen you.
Fernand:
It's no coincidence that my father suddenly remarried shortly after. My half-sister... She was only four years old... She was his hope.
Clive:
Of course--but you, a proud and accomplished knight, were his hope as well. What are you saying, Fernand?
Fernand:
...With their passing, our proud and ancient bloodline will die with me. There are no other heirs to it left alive, and I am... nothing more than a broken branch on our family tree.
Clive:
Don't say that, Fernand. Hope is not lost for you yet. You are a strong, handsome, refined knight, more than you even know. The ladies will flock to you in due time. Someday, you'll--
Fernand:
No, Clive. I will not. I was not made like you. I was not made to love a woman. ...My father realized it, that very night. The abject disappointment that veiled his gaze is burnt forever into my mind.
Clive:
...Oh, Fernand, I--I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you into--
Mathilda (offscreen):
Clive! Oh, where has he gone now? Clive?
Fernand:
...Your lady is calling for you. You should go to her.
Clive:
But, Fernand--
Fernand:
Just... go. Before I change my mind. Now go!

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Y-Yes, well...[NL][CloseEyes]
he usually tells me everything.[AN][OpenEyes]
Surprise or not.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, are you all right?[NL]
You look oddly pale.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry.[NL]
This is joyous news, I know.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
I suppose I'm just[Beat][NL]
not feeling well, is all.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, you know this won't change[NL]
anything between the three of us.[AN]
If that's what's on your mind--[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Oh, I think enough has[NL]
changed already.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Is it because Clive didn't speak[NL]
a word of this to you?[AN]
I assure you--it isn't as if[NL]
you'll be left out.[AN]
In fact, Clive insisted that[NL]
you'd be his best man--[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Is that supposed to be some sort[NL]
of consolation prize?[AN]
Do I look like the type of man[NL]
who settles for second place?![AN]
[MidRight]
Second place--? Fernand,[NL]
what's this all of a sudden?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you even realize what you've[NL]
taken from me today, you callous--[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
--Now hold a moment, if this is how[NL]
you speak to the woman you claim[AN]
to hold feelings for,[NL]
then I believe I made the right--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
--Oh, you REALLY think this is[NL]
about YOU? What arrogance![AN]
There's only one man worthy of[NL]
my heart, and that's--[AN]
[Beat][NL]
That's...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat][CloseEyes] I've said too much already.[NL]
I must excuse myself.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Fernand![NL]
Fernand, wait--[AN]
