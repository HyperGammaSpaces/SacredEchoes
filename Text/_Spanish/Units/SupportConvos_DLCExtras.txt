What a relief it is to see you again, Nomah. I knew leaving Celica to your care was the right decision.
[Nomah]
Ah, it was an honor and pleasure. We've done it, haven't we? The children of prophecy have reunited, and it's in their hands now.
...Though, it wounds me that that's the first thing you say to your old friend after ten years, hm?

Ha! It feels like only yesterday. How long has it been since last I set foot in Rigel? Forty years, surely. The cold's much harsher on these old bones now. We were so young then, weren't we?

When this peace finally comes... there'll be no call for me to swear my life to the blade anymore. I'll settle somewhere quiet and take up the plow. Perhaps Ram Village, perhaps somewhere else.
[Nomah]
Perhaps Novis Island? The priory's been in grave need of some farmers, you know.
[Mycen]
Heh. You just want the company.
[Nomah]
So transparently put! But it makes sense, don't you think? So many years have passed, enough to where we haven't anyone else in waiting. If you'd settle for staying with little old me, that is.
[Mycen]
It's hardly settling. Maybe it would do us good to clean the slate. Try again. See where it goes.
[Nomah]
Now, now, there's no slate to clean. I understood. We were looking for different things. But now the little ones are sorted off together. We've made it! Our destinies came together once more the day you asked me to look after Celica, but only now do we have the peace to enjoy it. I'd be delighted to take up with you again.

[C]
[Silque]
Really, Acantha, I can't express my gratitude enough for getting me out of that bind in the shrine.
[Acantha]
Aw, seriously! Don't mention it. You'll embarrass me. I've got a bit of a reputation to uphold.
[Silque]
A reputation, hmm...?
[Acantha]
You know. A dashing, no-gooder rogue who steals anything that isn't nailed down! How am I supposed to be taken seriously as a criminal if I'm rescuing damsels left and right?!
[Silque]
I don't see how a reputation as a criminal is at all a desirable thing...
[Acantha]
Well, it's certainly better than no reputation at all, that's for sure. Life's boring without a juicy story now and then.
[Silque]
It's not that I don't appreciate gossip--far from it. I've heard the stories about a certain hard-drinking, gambling woman who frequents Zofia's taverns and bleeds men dry with her sleight-of-hand card tricks...
[Acantha]
Oh my. So you HAVE heard of me. Hee hee.
[Silque]
It would be impossible not to, if you've got an ear for that. However... don't you think you're better than that?
[Acantha]
...To be honest, I think they might be exaggerating JUST a little.
[Silque]
That's not exactly how I meant it. Just remember, Acantha, that the Mother is always watching.
[ClearFace]
[Acantha]
...What's that supposed to mean? Tch. Church girls... Tough crowd.

[B]
[Acantha]
So, uh, about this whole "Church of Mila" thing... mind telling me more? What's it like being a priestess?
[Silque]
Ah, of course! I'm glad you've taken an interest. After morning prayers, most of our early hours are spent in study and meditation. At noontide we take on community service projects - bringing meals to the poor and infirm, maintaining the gardens, looking after those who are ill. At night we prepare the offerings of food to Mother Mila.
[Acantha]
When's the fun stuff start?
[Silque]
Excuse me...?
[Acantha]
You know... making wine, brewing ale... the stuff a roguish scoundrel like myself might enjoy?
[Silque]
Oh-- well, on holy days we crush grapes and prepare the mash, but that all goes into the barrels to ferment for another year. It's a slow process, after all--
[Acantha]
Oh, come on! No need to be modest. You're telling me you're in a priory with a bunch of single women who worship a goddess of fertility, surrounded by barrels of fine draught, and there's not even a LITTLE drunken revelry?
[Silque]
--I'm afraid that's only a rumor...

[A]
[Silque]
Acantha, I must ask. Were your questions about the church... genuine?
[Acantha]
Genuine? Oh, yeah, of course. I'm super into... you know... uh... religious feasts! Nothin' like a good meal to make you appreciate divine providence 'n such.
[Silque]
Is that all...? The life of a true devotee is one of temperance and modest means. It's hardly a life of glamour and revelry. If you truly intend to serve in the church, I fear you've got your hopes set a little high.
[Acantha]
Aw, c'mon. My mother's sick. I gotta do something to pay for her medicine, you know. Might as well come by it honestly if I've got the chance.
[Silque]
...Oh, is that so?
[Acantha]
Well, it'd give me an excuse to get to know you better, too.
[Silque]
Well... if you want to do the right thing, even if it's for the wrong reasons... That's still a start.

Excuse me, sir--
Luthier, was it?
[MidLeft]

[MidRight]
I just wanted to check
if you were well. Magic
takes a toll on the body,
and I'm worried you're
pushing yourself too much.
[MidLeft]
Magic--Oh. You were talking
to... me?
[MidRight]
Er--yes, I was.
...Would you rather I didn't?
[MidLeft]
That wasn't what I meant.
I intended to communicate that,
er... that doesn't happen
very often. I was merely
caught off guard.
[MidRight]
I see...
Luthier, I've noticed you don't
ask for help even when you've
exhausted your magic reserves.
So I wanted to be proactive and
see how you're doing.
[MidLeft]
That's not necessary.
I know my limits.
[MidRight]
Well, I'm sure you do, but I would
prefer that no one in our group
neglects their health. So please
let me know if you're feeling weary.
[MidLeft]
If you insist.
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
...Well, he's certainly... curt.

## SilqueLuthier_B
[MidLeft][LoadSilque]
[MidRight][LoadLuthier]
[MidRight]
I require your assistance.
[MidLeft]
Oh--hello, Luthier.
How are you feeling?
Should I heal you up?
[MidRight]
No, there's no need for that.
Well--maybe as a demonstration.
You see--you've mastered a type
of magic I do not yet have command of.
Teach me your ways. I must study it.
[MidLeft]
...Um, well, I'm not sure how much
I can teach... White magic comes from
faith and piety. I could help lead you
in prayer sometime, but faith itself
isn't something I can teach.
[MidRight]
Obviously. Magical ability comes from
the blood. But magical applications
come from intense study. There must be
some holy text or ritual you perform
to maintain your communion with the
spirits. In this case, I should say,
with Mila herself. I presume she is
the source of healing magic, as
described in the Zofian Grimoire,
page 47, paragraph 2. "The Mother
giveth to the land the power of life,
and to the plants which grow in--"
[MidLeft]
--Er, yes, I've read that. It's
just as you said, prayer to Mila
reinforces your bond of faith, and--
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah, so you've read it too! I've
been searching for someone to discuss
its merits with. So few seem to have
truly studied the text. I'm currently
on my one hundred and fifth re-read.
[MidLeft]
That's very dedicated of y--
[MidRight]
--What did you think of the author's
description of the transfer of
life-force between caster and spirit?
I visualize it each time I cast.
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Er, well, truthfully, I've only
skimmed it. I know little of magic
beyond the church's teachings.
I preferred to learn through
practical applications - healing
the sick, meeting others on
pilgrimages...
[MidRight]
You really must finish reading it.
I insist--it's life-changing.
It's my gift to you in knowledge
so that perhaps you will share
your knowledge with me.
I hope this can be the start of
a regular discusson on magical
study techniques.
[MidLeft]
...All right, Luthier.
Let's make a deal.
I'll read the whole book
if you can promise me you'll
put your health first.
Come visit me at the first
sign of weariness.
--And don't stay up
all night reading.
[MidRight]
Mm... I'm afraid that will be
tough to commit to.
But if that's what is needed to
advance my knowledge of white magic,
then you have my word.

## SilqueLuthier_A
[MidLeft][LoadLuthier]
[MidRight][LoadSilque]
[MidLeft]
I thought seriously about what you
said, and I've found it to be
empirically true that studying with
others leads to a greater rate of
information absorption. You mentioned
going out and meeting others on
pilgrimages. ...Perhaps that's
what I've been missing.
[MidRight]
...You seem to keep to yourself
quite a lot. I think it would do
your soul some good to travel
and speak with others more often.
[MidLeft]
I find that prospect frankly...
terrifying. People don't often like
to talk with me, you see. In fact,
I... really don't have any friends.
[MidRight]
...You don't?
[MidLeft]
Well--I do, but... I suppose cats
don't count...
[MidRight]
Oh, you love cats too? We used to
keep some in the priory's granary
to help with the mice. I'd always
visit them after evening prayers.
It seems they only liked me when
I brought them fish, though.
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ah, that's a common misconception.
You may think them aloof creatures,
but when they turn and sit quietly,
not facing you, it's actually a sign
of affection, as the cat feels
comfortable enough to not have to
keep watch over y--
[MidRight]
--You know, Luthier, when you talk
about something you love,
your whole face lights up.
[MidLeft]
...Oh.
If I'm boring you,
please say so.
[MidRight]
Oh, no, that's not a bad thing.
It's a sign of dedication and passion.
[MidLeft]
... ...
That's... the nicest thing anyone has
ever said to me.
[MidRight]
All I ask is that you take better
care of yourself so you can pursue
those passions. Put the candle out
before the rooster crows. Get out
and talk more with others who love
the same things you do.
I'm sure you'll find more friendly
ears than you thought you would.
[MidLeft]
...All right, I've decided.
I will venture forth and find a
commune of mages with whom I can
discuss my studies.
...Since you're the one who
inspired this idea, I'd like to
extend the invitation to you as well.
[MidRight]
...Well, after the war ends...
It was my hope to give aid to the
people of Zofia as they rebuild and
recover. But someday... I would like
to travel again. Don't delay your
dreams because of me, but when you
return to Valentia, perhaps I'll
depart with you then.

Clair: Oh! Lady Mathilda.
Mathilda: Ah, Clair. It's been a while since we've spoken like this.
Clair: It really has. I was dreadfully worried about you after Desaix took you captive. Thanks be to the mother that you're safe and sound.
Mathilda: No, thank YOU, Clair. It was your relentless fighting that put Desaix's machinations to an end.
Clair: I know what it's like to be held prisoner. I remember how small my cell was in the Southern Outpost. I could hardly sleep at night for fear of what might happen to me. But when I imagine what you went through... And how long you endured...
Mathilda: You have a good heart, Clair. It means everything to me to know you cared so deeply. But I was never afraid. I knew in my heart that Clive would come for me.
Clair: You truly are strong, Mathilda. I hope that I might learn from your courage.

Mathilda: Ah. Forgive me. Id din't mean to stare. I just cannot help but notice how much you've changed.
Clair: Me? In what way?
Mathilda: Do you recall the last time we spoke like this? You were so compassionate. Recently, I've taken note of how you look out for everyone around you. You're there for them before they even think to ask for help. You've grown into a fine woman.
Clair: Really? I hadn't noticed. Also, I think you may be imagining it.
Mathilda: Aha, but you just proved it.
Clair: I... did?
Mathilda: The old Clair would have snapped at the suggestion she'd done any growing up. You always did hate being treated as a child, even when it was the case.
Clair: What? That simply isn't true! ...Well, maybe it's a LITTLE true.
Mathilda: Ha ha ha.

## ClairMathilda_A
Clair: Lady Mathilda.
Mathilda: Hello, Clair. Do you need something? It's not often you come to me looking for conversation.
Clair: Something you told me before has been foremost in my mind of late.
Mathilda: And what is that?
Clair: You said I'd grown into a fine woman, but then I started thinking about it... It's not so much that I grew up as that I had to leave part of myself behind. I miss the old days when Clive and Fernand and I lived in the castle. Being a knight of Zofia was hard work, but I was basically carefree. If ever I became cheeky with you, it's because I was...happy. But then the war came and crushed all of our dreams. I grew up thinking that the world revolved around me. But now I feel it's just spinning madly about for absolutely no reason at all.
Mathilda: Clair...
Clair: I know, I know. You're going to tell me this is what it means to grow up. But I MISS the part of me that believed things would always turn out all right.
Mathilda: You may mourn it all you like, Clair. But such loss IS part of growing up, and it's turned you into a fine woman.
Clair: ...Thank you, Mathilda.
Mathilda: And by the way--who ever said that our dreams have been crushed? It's true that things don't always turn out the way we want them to. But we can still find other ways to realize our desires. Just because you see the world for what it is doesn't mean you have to give up.
Clair: I...supposed you're right. I have to be stronger. Clive needs me to keep my chin up, after all.
Mathilda: You will be happy again one day, Clair. I promise you this. And Clive and I intend to be part of that happiness.
Clair: I hope so.
Mathilda: I KNOW so. And feel free to lean on me more, okay? After all, we'll be sisters someday.
Clair: Heh, if you keep being this nice, I SUPPOSE I'll allow it.
Mathilda: Ha ha ha! Thank Goodness for that!

Since I was small, all I've ever wanted[NL]

I lost out on some of the best years[NL]

You convinced me I was being a fool.[AN]
As a boy, I told myself the only books[NL]
I had use for were combat manuals.[AN]
I passed up countless valuable lessons[NL]
just to prove a point to my father.[AN]
Now I'm trying to serve as lieutenant[NL]

Every day is a painful reminder of[NL]
just how little I actually know.[AN]

Every time I barely escape with my life[AN]

Nothing to worry about.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tobin, your arm is bleeding really bad.
You should go to the back and get it
patched up before it gets any worse.
[MidLeft]
Alm, listen, I'm fine.
Go on back to the front lines.
I'm perfectly fine.
[MidRight]
Tobin, listen to me.
I know you don't want to admit it,
but it's obvious that you're in pain,
and I need you to acknowledge the fact
that if you don't get this treated,
you could die.
[MidLeft]
Would you just buzz off!?
I said I'm fine!
[MidRight]
Tobin, what happens if I let you go[NL]
off with a grisly wound like that[AN]
and it gets you killed?[AN]
What do you expect me to do,[NL]
carry my best friend all the way home[AN]
to Ram Village in a box!?[AN]
And explain to his family that he died[NL]
a stupid death because he was too[AN]
proud to admit that he was injured!?[AN]
If you don't care about how I feel,[NL]
then for the sake of your parents,[AN]
please go and get patched up![AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, alright.
Good goblets, you're paranoid.[AN]
But out of respect for my folks,[NL]
I'll go to the back and get patched up.[AN]
But this isn't over, Alm.[NL]
Be ready, because we're going to duel,[AN]
just like we used to when we were[NL]
in training with Sir Mycen![AN][HalfCloseEyes]
And I'm going to show you just how[NL]
wrong you are about me...![AN]

Hey, Alm, I'm sorry about what[NL]
I said to you the other day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
For what you said to me when I was[NL]
holding you down so the cleric[AN]
could tend to your wounds, or[NL]
for what you said to me in our duel?[AN]
[MidRight]
Both.[NL]
The way I talked to you[AN]

was inappropriate of me,[AN]
and I just wanted you to know that[NL]
I didn't mean anything by it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's alright, Tobin. Really.[NL]
I'm not Kliff.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
No, it's not alright.[AN]
You've been nothing but concerned[NL]
about me, and in turn,[AN]
I yelled at you and[NL]
gave you a hard time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tobin. Listen to me.[AN]
You made a mistake. You apologized.[NL]
Let it go and learn from it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Alm... I just want to impress you guys.[NL]
I want to impress my siblings.[AN]
When I come home from the war,[AN]
I don't want them to be hearing about[NL]
the exploits of Alm and his soldiers,[AN]
I want them to hear about the[NL]
exploits of Tobin![AN]
How he persevered, and... how[NL]
he did something worth talking about![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But Tobin, you've already done that![NL]
You joined the Deliverance to be able[AN]
to put food on the table for[NL]
your family back home.[AN]
Your efforts are going to put your[NL]
little brothers through school.[AN]
Even if you don't make a big name[NL]
for yourself, you'll always be[AN]
the hero that gave your[NL]
brothers an education.[AN]
And at the end of the day,[NL]
I feel like they'd care about that[AN]
a lot more than they'd care about what[NL]
me and Gray and everyone else has done.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah... Yeah! You're right![AN]
And I have you and Gray[NL]
behind me all the way![AN]
Thanks, Alm![AN]

Don't mention it.[NL]

Mhmm. And a pretty damn good one, too.[AN]

And he gets to travel the world?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Uh-huh.[AN]

Has he ever told you stories[NL]

From the extravagant cities[NL]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You must be jealous of him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not really.[AN]
He's always being hassled by[NL]
brigands and rogues,[AN]
and escorts cost a fortune for[NL]
journeys outside of Valentia.[AN]
I don't see how he can[NL]
stand being a merchant.[AN]
As it stands, we only just[NL]

We'd be better of just harvesting[NL]
livestock and crop like everyone else.[AN]

If I could travel the world[NL]

Sorry for what I said earlier, alright?[AN]

relationship was a sore spot for you,[AN]
and it was rude of me to bring that up.[AN]
I was just angry that you didn't[NL]

seeing the world--meanwhile,[AN]

I wish I could've met my father.[NL]
Who knows how much better off Mother[AN]
would have been if he hadn't abandoned[NL]

[MidRight]
Kliff... I'm sorry.[AN]
I forget that your mom wasn't[NL]
always like that.[AN]
Back when Celica was still around,[AN]
she was always doting on[NL]
her perfect genius son.[AN]
Which, by the way, meant that me and[NL]
Tobe were "those dirty village boys"[AN]

Hey Kliff. How's tricks?[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you have a moment?[AN]
[MidLeft]
All the time in the world,[AN]
give or take the battle[NL]
we're in right now.[AN]
What's on your mind?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's it like outside of Valentia?[AN]
[MidLeft]
How do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight]
You said your father told you[NL]
stories of his travels.[AN]
I want you to tell me[NL]
what Archanea's like.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I'll bite.[NL]
Whaddya wanna know?[AN]
[MidRight]
What do you know about Khadein?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ooh, that's a fancy one to start with![AN]
Khadein is a beautiful city hidden[NL]
deep in the heart of an unholy desert.[AN]
It's home to the greatest[NL]
magic school on the continent,[AN]
so they're always in need of[NL]
potion ingredients and such.[AN]
Many merchants steer clear of it,[NL]
given how treacherous the journey is,[AN]
but my pa's gone down[NL]
that road many times.[AN]
[MidRight]
So your father's been there...[AN]
Has he ever crossed paths with[NL]
a man about his age,[AN]
with white hair, and one finger[NL]
missing from his left hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not that I know of. How come?[AN]
[MidRight]
Because my father was a mage.[AN]
Mother told me he vanished one day[NL]
when she began to show,[AN]
leaving nothing else but[NL]
his medal of graduation[AN]
from Khadein's academy.[AN]
He left in search of greater knowledge,[NL]
walking the path of a nomad.[AN]
No woman or child could tie him down.[AN]
And I feel like that's why my mother[NL]
is the way she is now.[AN]
She doesn't want me to leave her[NL]
like her lover did long ago.[AN]
She hates me because I remind her[NL]
so much of the man she loved.[AN]
And she's not wrong.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] That's... Wow.[NL]
That sucks.[AN]
[MidRight]
I want to travel the world.[AN]
Not just to escape from the pigsty[NL]
that I was raised in,[AN]
but in hopes that some day,[NL]
I will find my father.[AN]
I want to meet the man I take after,[NL]
and tell him how much I hate him.[AN]
Tell him how much suffering he's[NL]
put upon me and my mother both.[AN]
I might even burn him[NL]
to ash with my magic.[AN]
Someone like him doesn't deserve[NL]
my kindness or my forgiveness.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Kliff... Have you ever considered that[NL]
maybe he was doing it to protect you?[AN]
[MidRight]
To protect us?[NL]
From what?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I dunno, maybe he had a[NL]
bounty on his head?[AN]
[MidRight]
Nope.[NL]
He was a talented mage,[AN]
but he was no one special,[NL]
and I hate him for it.[AN]
And even worse, I hate that I'm[NL]
going to end up the same way.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
As in knocking a maiden up[NL]
and then abandoning her[AN]
in hopes of acquiring more[NL]
knowledge of the world?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
No. I want to leave Ram behind[NL]
once this war is over.[AN]
My mother won't let me,[NL]
and will beg me,[AN]
even try and force me,[NL]
to stay, but I won't.[AN]
I'm going to leave her because I've[NL]
had enough of manure and barn animals,[AN]
and I'm going to travel far and wide.[NL]
In that regard, I take after my father.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's just you.[NL]
She can't blame you for growing up![AN]
[MidRight]
I know. I've told her the same thing[NL]
countless times.[AN]
In the end, I always end up with a[NL]
bump on my head, and then she[AN]
has to buy a new broom the next day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then don't hate yourself[NL]
for pursuing your dream.[AN]
You can't let your ma[NL]
hold you back forever.[AN][ToggleSmile]
If you want to travel the world,[AN]

I have no interest in people.[AN]

So EXCUSE ME for being a little hesitant[NL]
to talk to every stranger I meet[AN]
who claims they want to get to know me.[AN]

Listen to yourself, Kliff![AN]
You are like a bitter old man[NL]

Blocking yourself off to[NL]
kindness and goodwill without[AN]
even giving them a chance,[NL]
all for selfish reasons.[AN]
I pray that you learn[NL]

Clair- (Focus, Clair... Despite how dashing and marvelous the boy is, he is still a commoner... You've talked to noblemen of much better quality than him and yet you must falter so now?!) Ah, salutations! 

Tobin- (She responded! I don't believe it! Come on, keep it going.) So, Clair, how's the pegasus? Not too bumpy I hope! Eheh... 

Clair- Oh it's simply marvelous, ahaha! Thank you so much for asking. (Marvelous? Thank you for asking? How utterly ridiculous!) 

Tobin- (How was the pegasus? Gah, stupid, stupid! Wait... She's still talking! Good goblets I'm doing better than I thought!) So, I was wondering, if you weren't busy later tonight... Maybe you'd want to go out for tea? We commoners don't have anything like you fancy nobles but the least I could do is treat you with something familiar. 

Clair- (Oh my, how astonishing! My luck is simply superb today!) Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed. I accept! Thank you so very much-!

Tobin- (By the mother...!) Th-then it's a date, then! Woo! Beat that, Gray! 

Clair- Hm? That's odd. I could have sworn I heard somebody speaking just now.

Tobin- Clair. 

Clair- Oh, hello, erm, Kliff? 

Tobin- Wha-!? You wound me milady. First you stand me up and now you're pretending like you don't even recognize me? 

Clair- I beg your pardon? 

Tobin- Just the other day I asked you to tea on the battlefield and you accepted! "Oh absolutely! That sounds wonderful indeed! I accept! Thank you so very much, Tobin!"

Clair- I- wh- Oh! Dear me! Don't you know that it's rude to pry on a lady like that?! 

Tobin- Wait, now you're accusing me of spying on you? You're heartless! 

Clair- Tobin- it is Tobin? I wasn't speaking to you.

Tobin- Then who were you talking to?! I was standing right behind you! There was nobody else around for miles! 

Clair- What I was doing is none of your business! Now please, put that event out of your mind, before I am humiliated any further! 

Tobin- I- Hang on! Clair wait! Was it something I said? 




A



Clair- *Sigh* You there, boy. I mean Tobin. 

Tobin- Hm... Oh yes hello... Clive was it? 

Clair- I suppose I deserve that. Look, what you saw the other day was merely me talking to myself. That is, practicing. 

Tobin- Why in Mila's name would you be practicing a speech? Milady, the way you speak it beautiful as is. 

Clair- Yes well, I was practicing to talk to... Someone special to me.

Tobin- You mean Alm, right? 

Clair- What? How did- yes it was Alm, but nevermind that. I feel so very awful about that whole ordeal. So as compensation, I was wondering if you'd be interested in having tea with me after this battle. 

Tobin- I thought you had feelings for Alm?

Clair- Alas, he doesn't feel the same I'm afraid. You seem nice enough Tobin.

Tobin- Then... (I've won! Suck on that Gra-) 

Clair- I was hoping you could tell me a bit about your friend Gray. 

Tobin- (Crivens...) Sure. Just name the place, milady.

Clair: Greetings, Fernand! It's been far too long.

Fernand: Ah, Clair. You know, it still confounds me that you decided to enlist with the knights. Your father is too lenient with you. Always has been.

Clair: And why shouldn't I be a knight?! I weild a lance and ride a horse as well as the best of you. Perhaps even better. Why else would they allow me to join? Heavens, you and my brother were the ones who TAUGHT me to fight and ride.

Fernand: Because you harangued us without end. You always were keen on following Clive. Honestly, we assumed it was a phase you would grow out of. You should be looking for a husband, not brandishing a weapon. Unless you expect to meet your soulmate on the battlefield?

Clair: I have no fondness for barbaric men. But pursuing a warrior's path does not doom me to a life of spinsterhood. Now that I'm a Knight of Zofia, I can stay here at the castle, where I can go to royal balls and meet fine gentlemen. What say you to THAT?

Fernand: I say that you should have listened to your vows more carefully. Knighthood affords little time to twirl about in circles and socialize. Day and night, we train and ride out on expeditions and other missions.

Clair: What?! Goodness, I don't remember pledging to do all that... Perhaps I will have to seek my beloved on the field of battle after all. Still, it's not all bad-the Knights are full of handsome noble scions, after all. ...I know! Fernand, why don't YOU introduce me to someone? Surely you must know many suitable suitors in suits of armor?

Fernand: Um... Well, I suppose it depends on what manner of man you fancy.

Clair: Hmm... Let me think... He'd have to come from a house at least as respectable as my own... He should be as tall as Clive, and fair of face... Well-lettered, and gifted in the arts of war and defense... And of course he must be well-versed in poetry and music and... Hmmm... Oh! He should own four villas, one for each of the seasons! Does that narrow it down?

Fernand: *sigh* It certainly does. You just described your brother.

Clair: That is not true!

Fernand: And you don't even realize it... Clearly you are still a child. You won't find a husband if you keep clinging to your brother in such a way.

Clair: Oh, really? And what about you? You've been clinging to my brother since before I was born, Fernand. Is there anything YOU should be telling me, hmmmmm? After all, you aren't exactly scrambling to find a pretty maid of your own.

Fernand: We are not talking about me!

Clair: Ha! Look at you, so easily shaken! I was merely teasing. Besides, Clive already told me what your true weakness is. He claims you prefer your ladies like your oranges-full and ripe. Now which of the knights' eligible ladies is juicy enough for you? Hmm...

Fernand: I am going to find your brother and bury him in a very deep hole... Touché, Clair. I'm glad you had your fun. Now farewell!

*Fernand leaves*

Clair: What? Wait, come back here! You can't run from your destiny!

In any case, pray forgive me[NL]
if I upset you.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm not upset.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Are you certain? It seems[NL]
every time I try to talk to you,[AN]
you refuse to look me in the eye.[AN]
If I did something wrong, tell me.[NL]
I don't want you to hate me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hate you? Of course not.[NL]
But all you ever ask about is Clive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh[Beat]right.[AN]
I can see how that would[NL]
be grating. It's just...[AN]
Well, your stories about Clive are[NL]
far more interesting than[NL]
the ones he tells.[AN]
[MidRight]
For true?[AN]
I can't imagine what I could tell you[NL]
that he hasn't already.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, if you only knew.[AN]
I adore talking with him, but[Beat][NL]
Well, he doesn't know how to loosen up.[AN]
He's very self-conscious.[AN]
I want to hear about his misadventures,[NL]
not just what he thinks I want to hear.[AN]
[MidRight]
So he never told you about sneaking[NL]
into the mess hall before lunch?[AN]
Or the story of licking the[NL]
cream off the cake?[AN]
Surely he's told you about trying[NL]
to ride those sheep?![AN]
He scared them so much,[AN]
they fled the pen and[NL]
rampaged across the village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha ha ha! I fear he neglected to[NL]
mention any of those escapades.[AN]
[MidRight]
He may look all gallant and composed,[NL]
but let me tell you...[AN]
Clive can be quite the ruffian when[NL]
no one is looking.[AN]
He makes me look like a saint.[NL]
I suggest you be careful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your suggestion is noted.[AN]
This is why I like talking[NL]
to you, Fernand.[AN]
...But it's not the only reason.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course I enjoy hearing about Clive.[AN]
But I also enjoy watching you[NL]
as you tell the stories.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Is that so?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your eyes light up when you[NL]
talk about him.[AN]
I can tell how happy it was for[NL]
the two of you to grow up together.[AN]
It's a type of affection that[NL]
he and I will never have.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, I wouldn't say that...[AN]
[MidLeft]
All I know is that I'd love to see[NL]
the site of Clive's sheep rampage,[AN]
or visit the kitchen where you[NL]
defrocked that poor cake.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'd be happy to take you.[NL]
And I'm not just saying that.[AN]
We can all go together:[NL]
you, me, and Clive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Fernand.[NL]
I would love that.[AN]
[X]

You were awfully chipper during[NL]
this morning's roundtable.[AN]
What's put such a glow upon[NL]
your visage today, Mathilda?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh--this? Well...[NL]
why don't you see for yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat][NL][ToggleSmile]
Oh.[AN]
That's a[Beat][NL]
very fine ring.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Clive asked for my hand in marriage[NL]
just the other night.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]D-Did he, now.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, he did. It took me[NL]
entirely by surprise![AN]
He'd floated the idea before,[NL]
but I thought he wished to wait[AN]
for the Deliverance to be in a[NL]
better position before[AN]
he actually asked.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
This is[Beat] the first I've heard[NL]
of such a plan.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Really, now?[AN]
He must've seriously been wanting[NL]
this to be a surprise![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Y-Yes, well...[NL][CloseEyes]
he usually tells me everything.[AN][OpenEyes]
Surprise or not.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, are you all right?[NL]
You look oddly pale.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry.[NL]
This is joyous news, I know.[AN][HalfCloseEyes]
I suppose I'm just[Beat][NL]
not feeling well, is all.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fernand, you know this won't change[NL]
anything between the three of us.[AN]
If that's what's on your mind--[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Oh, I think enough has[NL]
changed already.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Is it because Clive didn't speak[NL]
a word of this to you?[AN]
I assure you--it isn't as if[NL]
you'll be left out.[AN]
In fact, Clive insisted that[NL]
you'd be his best man--[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Is that supposed to be some sort[NL]
of consolation prize?[AN]
Do I look like the type of man[NL]
who settles for second place?![AN]
[MidRight]
Second place--? Fernand,[NL]
what's this all of a sudden?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you even realize what you've[NL]
taken from me today, you callous--[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
--Now hold a moment, if this is how[NL]
you speak to the woman you claim[AN]
to hold feelings for,[NL]
then I believe I made the right--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
--Oh, you REALLY think this is[NL]
about YOU? What arrogance![AN]
There's only one man worthy of[NL]
my heart, and that's--[AN]
[Beat][NL]
That's...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat][CloseEyes] I've said too much already.[NL]
I must excuse myself.[AN][ClearFace]
