One more thing, Alm.[.5] You've all brought[NL]

swords, but I'm trained in the lance.[AN]

[Red]Basic weapons[Red] all perform similarly in[NL]

a fair fight, but you should be aware[AN]

of the qualities of better equipment.[NL]

[Red]Stronger weapons[Red] are more specialized.[AN]

This iron lance [Red]works well against swords,[Red][NL]

but it won't [Red]fare well against axes.[Red][AN]

Keep this in mind as you equip weapons.[AN]
