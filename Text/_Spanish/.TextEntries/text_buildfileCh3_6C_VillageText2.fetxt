Only one of Zofia's royal bloodline[NL]

can open the temple's sluice gate.[AN]

With His Highness Lima IV deceased,[NL]

who is left to take his place?[AN]

What's more, I hear the western gate[NL]

has been occupied by Rigelian forces.[AN]

At this rate, Zofia is at risk of[NL]

a flood like we've never seen before.[AN]

Please, take this ring.[AN]

If worst comes to worst, it's said[NL]

to protect against drowning.[AN]
