Wheeeew![.4] It sure is nice to be[NL]
out of that creepy forest.[AN]
If we'd been stuck there any longer,[NL]
I would've had to start blaming yew![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mm... Well, I'm glad you're[NL]
keeping your spirits up, Mae.[AN]
We could all use morale like[NL]
yours at a time like this.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh,[.4] Celica,[.4] if you hadn't noticed,[NL]
I was making a joke.[AN]
You're supposed to laugh?[AN][ToggleSmile][MoveMidRight]
C'mon, you don't have to be[NL]
such a birch about it![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Right...[.4] I'm sorry.[.4] There's a[NL]
lot on my mind right now.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
I knew that, silly![.4] That's why[NL]
I was trying to make you laugh![AN]
You know, to get your[NL]
mind OFF all that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...You're a good friend, Mae.[NL]
I appreciate it, truly.[AN]
But this...[.4] This isn't the time[NL]
for laughter and games.[AN]
There's too much riding on my shoulders[NL]
to risk loosening them now.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][MoveLeft]
Celica?![.4] Celica, wait![AN][MoveLeft]
Princess or not, you're[NL]
still my best friend![AN]
What happened to my best friend, huh?![AN]

You seem troubled, little one.[AN][2NL]
Were Sage Halcyon's words[NL]
any comfort to you?[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
They were.[.4] I know now what I must do.[AN]
...Though,[.4] truthfully,[.4] it doesn't make[NL]
what I must do any easier to stomach.[AN]
[MidRight]
Speak of it to me, child.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I cannot.[AN][2NL]
The look on Alm's face[NL]
when I told him...[AN]
I won't be able to bear it if[NL]
I see that look on yours as well.[AN]
All we can do is trust in[NL]
Mila's will, and move forward.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You told the boy goodbye,[NL]
didn't you?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...![.4][ToggleMouthMove] How did you--[AN]
[MidRight]
Call it intuition--[.4]I,[.4] too,[.4][NL]
have said my share of goodbyes[AN]
to those I've held dear.[AN]
In such times, we must remember:[NL]
The wefts of our lives and bonds[AN]
are both woven and clipped in turn[NL]
as the Mother wills it.[AN]
We cannot know the full design of[NL]
her tapestry;[.4] we can only trust[AN]
that our own threads fit into it,[AN]
guided through by the needle of our own[NL]
resolve in the grasp of her expert hand.[AN]
So I must ask--[.4]what is the needle[NL]
to which you've threaded your fate?[AN]
[MidLeft]
...The Brand exists to guide me.[AN]
And the Brand marks my blood as that[NL]
which can heal the gods' illness.[AN]
[MidRight]
And your heart says this is right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It does.[.4] Restoring the gods[NL]
will heal this suffering land.[AN]
[MidRight]
To say that without hesitation[NL]
tells a story in itself.[AN]
...Then I, too, will trust in the Mother.[NL]
You needn't add my worries to your own.[AN][ToggleSmile]
As sure as your faith is, mine,[NL]
too, will guide me through.[AN]
So fear not,[.4] little one,[.4] and know[NL]
that wherever your thread may end,[AN]
you'll be led there by the strength of[NL]
your faith and the will of the Mother,[AN]
and the stitch you'll make together[NL]
will anchor countless others.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you...[.4][CloseEyes] Nomah...[AN]

Señor máscara.[NL]
Tenemos que hablar.[AN]
[MidRight]
Este... ¿sobre qué?[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
Has tenido un montón de furtivas[NL]
[0x93]conversaciones privadas[0x94] con Celica.[AN]
¿Creíste que no me había dado cuenta?[AN]
[MidRight]
Qu... ¿Qué? M-[.4]me temo[NL]
que yo no--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][Right]
No te hagas el tonto, niño.[AN]
Sé la razón por la que chicos de tu edad[NL]
quieren audiencia privadas con princesas.[AN]
Si te atreves a ponerle UN dedo a ella,[NL]
te lo arrancaré directo de tu mano.[AN]
¿Me entiendes?[.4] ¿O te lo explico[NL]
con dibujitos y señales?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][FarRight]
D-[.4]¡¿Disculpa?![.4] No, no, creo que[NL]
ocurrió un malentendido, yo NO--[AN]

Entonces debes tener una maldita[NL]
coartada,[.4] y que sea buena.[AN]

Yo--[.4] Em,[.4] bueno,[.4] eres--[AN][MoveFarRight]
No puedo evitar,[.4] eh,[.4] notar lo[Beat][NL][ToggleSmile]

cuando me agarras del collarín[NL]
de esa forma.[.4] Je...[AN]
¿Nadie le ha contido nunca lo[NL]
guapísimo que es, señor?[AN]

Mucha gente,[.4] de hecho.[AN]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]
Sí,[.4] ¡por supuesto![.4] Y sus ojos--[.4][NL]

brilla como cuando el sol ilumina[NL]
un vaso de cerveza fina--[AN]

Si a eso le llamas [0x93]coqueteo[0x94],[.4]
supongo que no tengo de qué preocuparme.[AN]
Pero recuerda,[.4] no puedes escapar de mí.[AN]
Te estoy vigilando.[NL]
No es ninguna broma.[AN][ClearFace]
