Alm? We're ready to march.[AN]
According to our intelligence,[NL]
Rigel's forces await in the[AN]
forest ahead. General Berkut[NL]
is commanding them personally.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Berkut...[.4] I guess they're serious[NL]
about holding the border.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed.[.4] Yet we've no[NL]
choice but to cross it.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
...Right.[AN]

You kept me waiting, Alm.[AN]
I was starting to wonder[NL]
if you'd actually come.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Berkut![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's quite the little army you've[NL]
assembled. I'm almost impressed.[AN]
For a ragtag group of gathered scraps,[NL]
the Deliverance actually looks the part.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Still, it seems you've all let a few[NL]
meager successes go to your heads.[AN]
Who are you to dare threaten[NL]
Rigel's borders? Lowborn fool.[AN]
Do you truly fancy yourself[NL]
the next king of Zofia?![AN][MoveMidLeft]
You must learn your place![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadClive][FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
You've got it all wrong, Berkut.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveFarLeft][MidLeft][LoadFernand][MidLeft][MoveLeft][Left]
Clive?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've been at Alm's side from the[NL]
outset, watching all that he has done.[AN]
He's a brave warrior, and a good man[AN] worthy of the crown. He's made such[NL]
clear to me time and again.[AN]
The right of kings is not decided[NL]
by blood or station.[AN]
It lies in what a man believes.[NL]
What keeps him up at night.[AN][MoveMidRight]
It lies in a man's actions![AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
E-[.4]Enough already![AN]
You would throw away your pride as a[NL]
Zofian noble and bow to a commoner?![AN]
I see now that the Clive I once knew[NL]
is well and truly dead.[AN][OpenEyes][MoveLeft]
Now it falls on me to bury him![AN]

What is it, sir?[AN]

Sorry. I'm ready.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
Warriors, it's time![AN]
Time to defeat Emperor Rudolf, and[NL]
bring this bloody war to an end![AN]
Now then--[.4]who will defend Zofia?![AN]

We will defend her![AN]

Nnngh... Damn you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're plenty strong, Berkut.[NL]
No one would deny that.[AN]
If you lay down your weapon, I'll[NL]
let you escape with your life.[AN]
But if you don't... I won't[NL]
give you a third chance.[AN]
[Right][OpenEyes][MoveRight]
Bah! Spare me your treacly platitudes![NL]
I was meant for greatness![AN]
But you, you're just a...[AN]

--What the devil do YOU want?![AN]
[FarRight][CloseEyes]
I[Beat][OpenEyes] I have a report.[NL]
We've taken severe casualties.[AN]
We'd be wise to use[NL]
this chance to escape.[AN]
[Left]
Who do you think you are to[NL]
give orders to me?![AN]
Perhaps you wish to scurry away[NL]
like the Zofian you are,[AN]
but I intend to stay and fight.[AN]
Had YOU not faltered in the[NL]
face of your former comrade,[AN]
I would've gotten my[NL]
rightful victory by now![AN]
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Lord Berkut, I would[NL]
ask that you LIVE![AN]
They offered you mercy.[NL]
Accept their terms.[AN]
His Excellency the Emperor[NL]
will understand.[AN]
[Left][MoveLeft]
Shut your mouth, Zofian scum![AN]
I would rather die here than crawl[NL]
back to my uncle to beg for mercy.[AN]
Mercy belongs in the limp wrists[NL]
of Zofia, not in the clenched fists[AN]
of Rigelian men where lances instead[NL]
ought to be!![AN]

You don't hear it?[NL]
What was that voice...?[AN]
So deep as to shake the[NL]
earth itself[Beat] It must be...[AN][ToggleSmile]
Yes. The War Father is calling to me.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Er... of course, milord.[NL]
Calling you to his temple.[AN][ToggleSmile]
So, clearly, we must... we must make[NL]

Should we go after them?[AN]

DAMN HIM![.4] Why?![NL]
Why can't I beat him?![AN]
To be humiliated so by a[NL]

My lord, please! You must[NL]
try to calm down.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

You are safe. That's[NL]
all I need to be--[AN]

Silence, woman! What could[NL]
you possibly know?![AN]
[Right]
...![AN][Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Berkut...[AN]
[MidLeft]
From childhood, all that's ever[NL]
been asked of me is strength.[AN]
It is my duty as one born to[NL]
stand above others.[.4] To rule.[AN]
I've been taught that all my life.[NL]
By my father, my mother...[AN][MoveMidLeft]
How am I to remain calm in the face[NL]
of defeat at the hands of peasants?![AN]
[MidRight]
Berkut? You're frightening me...[NL]
I-[.4]I can brew you some tea if you'd--[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
I said SILENCE![.4] The only comfort[NL]
I need is more power![.4] The War Father[AN]
has chosen me, and me alone.[AN]
I will go and pray to Him,[AN][ToggleSmile]
and it is through His power I will[NL]
crush that uppity farm-boy myself!![AN][ToggleSmile][ClearFace]

Sir Fernand... You didn't[NL]

[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
...My apologies.[NL]
I did not mean to eavesdrop.[AN][OpenEyes]
I've been keeping close watch on[NL]
him since he began acting strange[AN]
at the battle of the border.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] I assure you. He's[NL]
not normally like this.[AN][.6]
[FarLeft]
He shouted at me the same way.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
I'm so sorry... He doesn't[NL]
mean it, I'm sure--[AN]
[FarLeft]
I've been thinking a lot[NL]
on something...[AN]
that a very dear friend said to me.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.6]
[FarLeft]
That a man's actions and convictions[NL]
are just as important as his bloodline.[AN]
When I became a knight in Zofia, I took[NL]
an oath to protect the defenseless.[AN]
I'd certainly never debase myself[NL]
to follow a commoner, but...[AN]
[MidRight]
Sir Fernand?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]No, it's nothing.[NL]
I daren't speak ill of our lord.[AN]
But... if you have need of[NL]
a sympathetic ear...[AN]
mine are open to you.[NL]
...I'll take my leave now.[AN][ClearFace][.6]
