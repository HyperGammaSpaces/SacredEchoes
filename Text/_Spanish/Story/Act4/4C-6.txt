Esta torre es masiva[Beat] Asfixiante.[AN]
Como si fuera el poder de Duma[NL]
personificado.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hay una inscripción aquí en el estrado.[AN][2NL]
[OpenQuote]Ni el rango ni la[NL]

Estas no son más que[NL]
las baratijas de los hombres. [AN]
No veré mortal hasta que[NL]
el fuego de la batalla lo haya[A][NL]
forjado a mi imagen.[AN]
Demuestra tu poder, y podrás estar de pie[NL]
ante mí como un guerrero elegido.[CloseQuote][AN]

¿Cómo exactamente podremos[NL]
[OpenQuote]demostrar nuestro poder[CloseQuote]?[AN]
[FarLeft]
El Sabio Halcyon, habiendo pasado esta prueba[NL]
muchas veces, me ha dicho algo de esto.[AN]
El [OpenQuote]munus[CloseQuote], en el idioma de nuestro[NL]

La gran puerta del altar de Duma es[NL]
sellado por su propio poder inmenso[AN]
hasta que él crea conveniente emitir[NL]
el pulgar vuelto del juicio.[AN]

Cada una de esas puertas parece que[NL]
conduce a una habitación pequeña.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Estos son los santuarios de combate.[AN]
Cuando la prueba empiece,[.4] un oponente[NL]
se materializará sobre el trono.[AN]
Normalmente, [ToggleRed]tomar el trono[ToggleRed][NL]
marca el fin de la prueba.[AN]
[Beat]En el estado actual del Padre Duma,[NL]
sin embargo...[.4] Me temo que puede tomar[AN]
más de una sola iteración para[NL]
saciar su sed de combate.[AN]
Puede que [ToggleRed]siga invocando oponentes[NL]
hasta que todos los tronos sean tomados.[ToggleRed][AN]
[Left][MoveRight]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Anthiese, ¡espera![.4] Una vez que reclames el[NL]
trono de un santurario,[.4] [ToggleRed]su puerta se sella[AN]
y seguirá así hasta que cada fase de[NL]
la prueba sea completada.[ToggleRed][AN]
Te lo suplico, ten mucho cuidado[NL]
conforme te enfoques en avanzar.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadCelica_Promoted]
Comprendo.[.4] Por mucho que desee probar[NL]
mi propio poder ante el Dios de la fuerza,[AN]
[ToggleRed] No debo apresurarme y poner en peligro[NL]
mi oportunidad de pararme frente a él.[ToggleRed][AN]
Aún así, me pregunto... estos santuarios no[NL]
pueden simplemente ser trampas[AN]
de un solo sentido, ¿verdad?[AN]
Si el oponente entra por[AN]
el trono, entonces tal vez pueda ser una[NL]
forma de [ToggleRed]salir a través de él [ToggleRed] también.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tienes un punto.[AN]
Sin embargo, yo pensaría que esos pueden[NL]
conducir a las catacumbas de abajo;[AN]
lejos de Duma y su cámara, pero cerca[NL]
de la salida de la torre.[AN]
[Right]
Entonces,[.4] puede que tenga un plan.[AN]
Voy a confiar en mis compañeros para[NL]
enfrentar las pruebas del santuario.[AN]

Funny how life works sometimes.[.4] A duel[NL]
was what got me exiled from this land,[AN]

Hah![.4] That's a princess for you, I guess![AN]

You will likely doubt me when I say this,[AN]
but it was Mila who petrified herself[NL]
to seal Falchion away within her.[AN]
Do not ask me her motive in this,[NL]
for I understand it not.[AN]
Perhaps with her dying breath,[AN]
she sought to shield her only kin[NL]
from meeting the same end...[AN]
Now, no force in this world remains[NL]
which can harm Lord Duma.[AN]

Mila, I don't understand...[NL][OpenEyes]
Why would you do this?[AN]
Why leave us at the mercy of your[NL]

Have you truly forsaken us...?[AN]

Your lamentations are wasted, child.[NL]
With Mila dead and Falchion sealed,[AN]
Lord Duma can only further deteriorate,[NL]
with no blade that can grant him mercy.[AN]
I have done all I can for him.[AN]
I have offered up countless sacrifices,[NL]
even my own progeny--[.4]all for naught.[.5][AN]
Only the blood of the Brand[NL]

So, I beseech you, Princess Anthiese:[AN]
pour the libation from your veins[NL]

I tried one last time to pull her[NL]
