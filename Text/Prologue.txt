[MidRight][LoadAlm]
[MidLeft][LoadMycen]
[MidLeft]
Well done, Alm. We'll end today's[NL]
training here. Your swordsmanship[AN]
has come a long way. I've always[NL]
known you had talent.[AN]
[MidRight]
You really think so?[AN]
You're not just saying that,[NL]
are you, Grandfather?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Either I'm getting old[NL]
or you're getting better--[AN]
and we both know I'm not old.[A]
[MidRight]
Ha! Well, good.[NL]
Then that means you're ready to[AN]
let me travel outside the village.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't misconstrue my words, boy.[NL]
The rule still stands.[A]
[MidRight]
But why?! I'm not a child anymore.[NL]
You just said I can fend for myself![AN]
If I meet with any dangers,[NL]
I'll have my sword and my wits.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alm, that's not what this is about.[A]
[MidRight]
Then what IS it about?[A]
[MidLeft]
Alm...[A]
[MidRight]
Look, I've heard from the others.[NL]
I know the drought's made Zofia[AN]
a scary place. People are starving,[NL]
and many have turned to thievery[AN]
and plunder. Brigands loot villages[NL]
for a mere sack of grain, and soon[AN]
they'll be at OUR door![AN]
And don't think I haven't heard what[NL]
the Rigelian army has been up to.[AN]
They've been crossing the border[NL]
for years in violation of[AN]
the Divine Accord. And with that[NL]
sacred bond broken, now the Terrors[AN]
have resurfaced as well...[AN]
[MidLeft]
...All true.[A]
[MidRight]
Zofia is full of innocent people[NL]
who are looking for help.[AN]
Please, Grandfather.[AN]
I want to make a difference in[NL]
a world bigger than a handful of houses.[AN]
I want to see all the amazing places[NL]
you've told me about--[AN]
that Celica told me about![AN]
[MidLeft]
Suppose you do set forth with[NL]
your sword and your wits. So what?[AN]
[MidRight]
...[A]
[MidLeft]
Will the grand story of your life be[NL]
how you met the end of a brigand's axe?[AN]
Before you dream of changing the world,[NL]
learn your damned place in it.[AN]
And no more talk of leaving.[A]
[Clear]
[MidRight]
...What's his problem?![NL]
Why teach me to use a sword if[AN]
you're not going to let me fight?[AN]
Every day in this place is exactly[NL]
the same as the next.[AN]
I know I'm meant for more than this![NL]
But you have to let me find it![AN]
[MidRight]
Huh? What's all the commotion?[NL]
It's coming from the gates. Hmm...[AN]
[X]

##OpeningScene_2
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
[Right][LoadGray]
[FarRight][LoadTobin]
[FarRight]
Alm! Hey. This fellow's here to see Sir[NL]
Mycen. He was just about to tell us more.[AN]
[Right]
Sorry, pal, but I still can't trust a[NL]
man in full armor. Keep one hand on your[AN]
hilt while you talk to this guy, yeah?[A]
[Clear]
[FarRight]
A knight--can you believe it?[NL]
What's he doing in OUR village?[AN]
You'd have to practically ride off[NL]
the edge of the map to find this place![AN]
[Clear]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
[MidRight]
Good day. You must be Sir Mycen's grandson.[NL]
Alm, was it? My name is Lukas.[AN]
[MidRight]
I fight for the Deliverance.[A]
[MidLeft]
The "Deliverance"? What's that?[NL]
Aren't you one of the Knights of Zofia?[AN]
The king's knights?[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, I see. I suppose that means word hasn't[NL]
yet reached your village. In that case,[AN]
please forgive me for heralding such[NL]
dark news, but...[AN]
King Lima IV is dead.[AN]
He met his end some days ago at the hands[NL]
of Chancellor Desaix.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What? You're saying it was regicide?![A]
[MidRight]
I fear so. It seems Desaix sold Zofia to[NL]
the Rigelian Empire along with his soul.[AN]
No doubt they promised him lands. Perhaps[NL]
even a title. Upon Lima's death,[AN]
the chancellor and the Rigelian army[NL]
seized Zofia Castle and began to visit[NL]
unspeakable injustices upon the king's[AN]
people. Sir Clive--of the Zofian Knights[NL]
you mentioned--would have none of it.[AN]
He formed an army to free us from Rigel and[NL]
named it the Deliverance. However, we are[AN]
outmatched and fast losing this war.[AN]
[MidRight]
We need a hero's aid.[AN]
[MidRight]
And so I have come to the home of one[NL]
of Zofia's greatest heroes: Sir Mycen.[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you see, Alm? Sir Clive would not[NL]
have sent me were it not urgent.[AN]
Will you take me to see your grandfather?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-yes, of course.[A]
[Clear]
[MidRight]
[Clear]

[FarRight][LoadTobin]
[Left][LoadFaye]
[FarLeft][LoadKliff]
[MidRight]
Good goblets... I knew Zofia was in[NL]
hot water, but is this guy serious?[AN]
[FarRight]
So there's going to be a war?[A]
[FarLeft]
There already is one,[NL]
from the sound of things.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's... that's awful![AN]
If Sir Mycen rides off to war,[NL]
what'll happen to Alm?[AN]
[FarLeft]
You got me.[A]
[X]

##OpeningScene_4
[FarFarLeft][LoadAlm]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
[MidRight]
Sigh...[A]
[FarFarLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Lukas! Were you able to speak with[NL]
my grandfather? What did he say?[AN]
[MidRight]
He said no. Sir Mycen made it clear he has[NL]
no intention of joining the Deliverance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
What? But he's ridiculously strong![NL]
He could defeat some stuffy chancellor[AN]
with his eyes closed! Why would he refuse[NL]
when so many people are suffering?[AN]
[MidRight]
I cannot speak to Sir Mycen's thinking,[NL]
but it seems we misplaced our hopes.[AN]
I'll have to return to our hideout and[NL]
bring Sir Clive the ill news.[AN]
Perhaps Mycen has simply grown[NL]
too old for the battlefield.[AN]
[MidLeft]
...![A]
[MidRight]
It was good meeting you, Alm.[NL]
I must be on my way.[AN]
Thank you again for your assistance.[AN]
[Clear]
[MidLeft]
He's not old...[NL]
He's tougher than men half his age![A]
[X]

##OpeningScene_5
[FarFarLeft][LoadAlm]
[Right][LoadTobin]
[FarRight][LoadLukas]
[Left][LoadGray]
[FarFarLeft]
[MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft]
Lukas, wait![AN]
[FarRight]
Alm? What is it?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'll go. I'll join the Deliverance.[AN]
[FarRight]
You?[AN]
[Right]
Alm, what the hell?![NL]
You can't do that![AN]
...Wait. CAN he do that?[AN]
[Left]
I'll admit, you fight like a beast and[NL]
they'd be lucky to have your sword,[AN]
but this isn't sparring with your[NL]
gramps, Alm. You're volunteering[AN]
to go to war![AN]
[FarLeft]
I know what it is. And if Grandfather[NL]
won't do it, then I'll do it for him.[AN]
Consider my sword as his.[NL]
[FarRight]
Alm, I understand how you feel, but--[AN]
[FarLeft]
Sir Mycen has been teaching me to[NL]
use a blade since I was a boy.[AN]
I've received tutelage in military tactics,[NL]
medicine, weather, terrain... I know[AN]
as much about war as any man who has[NL]
never seen one can. Let me fight for you[AN]
with my grandfather's gifts.[NL]
I'll prove he's no cowardly old man.[AN]
He's a warrior who trains warriors.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hmm... That might just work.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Huh? Then you mean...![AN]
[Right]
[Clear]
[Right][LoadKliff]
[Right]
Oh, come ON! You can't be serious![AN]
[FarRight]
Why not? Alm presents a good case.[NL]
He has a hero's blood in him.[AN]
...And clearly a hero's fire.[NL]
His presence is sure to raise[AN]
the troops' morale. And for my part,[NL]
I'm curious to see what a[AN]
self-proclaimed warrior can do.[NL]
Especially now that he'll be[AN]
doing it for the Deliverance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Thank you, Lukas...[NL]
You won't regret this![AN]
[Left]
I've seen a lot of cake-taking in[NL]
my day, but this REALLY takes the cake![AN]
[Left]
[Clear]
[Left][LoadFaye]
[Left]
Alm, you should back out of this.[NL]
It's far too dangerous! If anything[AN]
were to happen to you, I'd...[NL]
I mean... Just don't do it, okay?![AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm sorry, Faye, but I've made up[NL]
my mind. But... maybe all of you[AN]
could come with me?[AN]
[Left]
Er, what?[AN]
[Right]
Splendid idea. Maybe we could all[NL]
get impaled on the same lance.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm just saying we could do it together.[NL]
...Fighting, I mean. Not the lance.[AN]
Grandfather trained all of us, right?[NL]
Not just me. You already know how to use[AN]
a sword and a bow. So what's the problem?[AN]
[Right]
[Clear]
[Right][LoadTobin]
[Right]
Alm, are you insane? We were sparring[NL]
with wooden fences and tree trunks![AN]
They don't hit back![AN]
[Left]
[Clear]
[Left][LoadGray]
[Left]
Oh, sod it all. I'm not as bright as[NL]
I'd like to think I am, so, uh...[AN]
count me in![AN]
[Right]
Gray! Not you too?![AN]
[Left]
Me too, Tobi-poo. Better'n waiting for[NL]
Rigel to reach Ram and kill/enslave us.[AN]
Might as well bring the fight to them.[AN]
[Right]
But you're gonna-- I mean, once they--[NL]
[....]...Ugggh![AN]
[FarRight]
You have my thanks, Gray.[NL]
And the Deliverance welcomes you.[AN]
In the end, we need every[NL]
able fighter we can get. There will be[NL]
much to learn, but I can teach you a[AN]
great deal in battle. And you'll be[NL]
given a proper wage, of course.[AN]
[Right]
Wait. You mean we get paid?[NL]
As in, actual money?[AN]
[FarRight]
Of course. Our soldiers work hard[NL]
and sacrifice much. We would be remiss[AN]
not to offer compensation.[AN]
[Right]
I've got little brothers and sisters[NL]
who could use that gold... Ma and Pa[AN]
struggle to make ends meet, but[NL]
if there's a way to help... Hmm...[AN]
[FarLeft]
Tobin, you don't have to go if[NL]
you don't want to. Why don't you all[AN]
take a little time to think about it?[NL]
Let's split up for now and meet back[AN]
here later. I need to go thank my[NL]
grandfather and say good-bye.[AN]
[FarRight]
Take all the time you need, Alm.[NL]
You should say a proper farewell[AN]
to Sir Mycen.[AN]
[X]

##OpeningScene_6
[Right][LoadAlm]
[Right]
Grandfather, I'm home![NL]
Do you have a minute?[AN]
There's something I need to[NL]
speak with you about...[AN]
Grandfather?[.....] Hmm, where is he?[NL]
Grandfather...? Grandfather![AN]
[X]

##OpeningScene_GetGrayAndTobin
[FarFarLeft][LoadAlm]
[Right][LoadTobin]
[Left][LoadGray]
[FarFarLeft]
[MoveFarLeft]
[Right]
...Ah! There he is. Alm, over here![AN]
[FarLeft]
Tobin! Does this mean[NL]
you're coming with us?[AN]
[Right]
Sure am! I could tell Ma and Pa were[NL]
worried, but I think they'll understand.[AN]
Listen, everyone, try not to be amazed[NL]
when I show Alm up on the battlefield.[AN]
[Left]
You know they don't pay extra[NL]
for that, right, moneybags?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLukas]
[FarRight]
There's nothing wrong with fighting for[NL]
coin. Many people do. We don't have any[AN]
rule stating one's reasons must be noble.[NL]
Now then, Alm. Were you able to[AN]
say good-bye to your grandfather?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I tried, but...I couldn't find him.[AN]
[FarRight]
Well, that IS vexing. I suppose we[NL]
could tarry here a bit longer if you--[AN]
[FarLeft]
It's all right. Let's go.[AN]
[FarRight]
Oh? Are you certain?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I can write him a letter.[NL]
Come on, we can't wait forever.[AN]
[FarRight]
So be it. I'll defer to your judgment.[AN]
[Clear]
[Right]
Alm, are you sure about this?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Am I sure about what?[AN]
[Right]
Not saying good-bye to your grandfather.[NL]
My ma and pa have all my brothers and[AN]
sisters to look after them. I mean, sure,[NL]
they'll miss me--or I hope they will,[AN]
at any rate--but family will help them[NL]
get by, you know? But all Sir Mycen has[AN]
for kin is you, and all you have is him.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I know. But considering he's never[NL]
let me take one step outside the village,[AN]
I doubt I could have talked him into[NL]
letting me join an army. Not that it[AN]
would have changed things either way--[NL]
I HAVE to go. Not just to prove him[AN]
as a teacher, but to prove myself to me.[AN]
[Left]
Well, you've always wanted to put[NL]
Ram behind you, right? This is your[AN]
big chance! Your first adventure[NL]
writ large! We'll call it Alm's Epoch![AN]
Or maybe... The Tale of Gray![NL]
...Plus That One Guy.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh. I don't think so. Although I admit[NL]
there might be a little something to[AN]
what you're saying. It's almost as if[NL]
I feel someone calling out to me.[AN]
[Left]
...So you really have gone crazy then.[NL]
Welp, it's been nice knowin' ya![AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh. Look, I know how it sounds.[NL]
But it's the truth.[AN]
[Right]
Do you think it's Celica?[AN]
[FarLeft]
What? Celica? Where the heck[NL]
did THAT come from?[AN]
[Right]
Oh, please. You two were inseparable[NL]
while she was here. You barely made[AN]
any time for us![AN]
[FarLeft]
I guess that's true...[AN]
[Right][Clear]
[Left][Clear]
[FarLeft]
Maybe it is her. Celica...[NL][CloseEyes]
are you the one who's been calling me?[AN]
I know that you're out there...[NL]
I just don't know where.[AN][OpenEyes]
But I can feel it. I hope this journey[NL]
will bring us together again...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadKliff]
[MidRight]
You know, I guess I don't mind going along.[NL]
The Deliverance is fighting all across[AN]
Zofia, right? Well, I've always wanted to[NL]
see the world, and now's my chance.[AN]
...All I have to do is not get killed.[NL]
Easy, right?[AN]
[X]

I'm staying with you no matter what![AN]

Uh, Faye--[A]

End! Of! Discussion![AN]

[MidRight]
Oy, travelers! 'Fraid I'm gonna have to[NL]
ask ya to stop right there. These here[AN]
woods belong to me and my boys, see?[NL]
So if ya wanna be passin' through,[AN]
yer gonna have to pay the toll. Ha ha![AN]
[Clear]
[Left]
Well. That didn't take long.[A]
[FarLeft]
Brigands already? But it's only been minutes--[NL]
we're still within sight of the gates![AN]
[Left]
Worse surprises than this await us, Alm.[NL]
Is everyone ready?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yes. Come on, let's clear this rabble out![AN]
[FarLeft]
[MoveFarRight]
Follow me. I'll clear us a path![AN]
[Left]
Alm, if I may? You mustn't rush headlong into[NL]
battles on your own. Without experience,[AN]
your friends will never grow into accomplished[NL]
fighters. Trust them. Give them something[AN]
to do.[AN]
[Left][CloseEyes]
...At least let them deal the final blow.[AN]
[FarRight][Clear]
[FarRight][LoadAlm]
[FarRight]
Oh. That's good advice. I'll give it a try![A]
[X]

##Ch1_1_PostBattle
[MidLeft][LoadAlm]
[MidRight][LoadLukas]
[MidLeft]
Yes! We won![AN]
[MidRight]
That was some fine swordsmanship, Alm.[NL]
I can see you have more than a bit[AN]
of your grandfather in you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You think so?[AN]
[X]
