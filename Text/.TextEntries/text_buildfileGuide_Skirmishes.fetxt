Sometimes, enemies will appear[NL]

on the world map. Moving onto[NL]

the same location as an enemy[NL]

will cause a battle to begin.[NL]

If you haven't cleared the[NL]

chapter at that location yet,[NL]

the enemy will bolster the[NL]

numbers of the opposing army[NL]

in the chapter battle, so[NL]

take them out quickly!
