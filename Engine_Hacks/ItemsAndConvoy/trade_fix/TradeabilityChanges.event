//NOTE: use the same weapon bit as "Negate WTA" to mark untradebility. Ability 2, 0x2 ("disable hammerne")

//2d4a8 seems to draw the items, look into graying out untradeable ones
//r2 is "is usable" which gets passed to DrawItemMenuCommand at 16848. If r2 is 0 then the text gets grayed.

//TEST THESE IN NO$, SHOPS ARE BREAKING

//17054 IsItemStealable - replace entirely to check for unstealable bit 0x2 on byte 0x4 of attributes

//Functions to actually change:
//$17584 GetItemUses ignore bit 6
//$1E188 SendToConvoyMenu (or even just thru "inventory_full.asm"?)
//$9E85C GiveConvoyEffect (supply_fix already messes w this)
//$9E2C8 TakeConvoyEffect

//and maybe in the textdraw func, color it based on which convoy its in??


//places to investigate: $9e872 $9a554 
//$31594 GiveItemToConvoy (WARNING this gets called when shuffling items too)
//$315cc
//$981E4 ???
//$9E100 ??? some graphics stuff, probably not needed
//9B74C?? convoy item drawing func?? (calls GetItemUses)
//9D300?? checks if item is usable by the current unit @9D37A, also calls GetItemUses
//ACE20?? (starts a new A20BB4 proc)
//AD51C (i think this draws the blue bar under highlighted item)

//$982B8 Shuffles items after item is removed

//$31508?? ClearConvoyITems - does exactly what it says, clears buffer at 203b200
//GetConvoyItemArray at 203b200 - check how these bits are saved and loaded

//$98014 i think this determines which pocket it goes in
//$98048 
// A188C0 = ?? Convoy item types? (Maybe reorg so that magic types arent drawn?)
//$9E854 ConvoyMenu_Give is probably where the bit should be set before calling 31594

//Temporary storage for item to be sent to convoy is at 0202BCB0+2E
//(202BCDE)

//08017584 GetItemUses - change this to not care about top byte.
//Kirb's system uses byte 7 to indicate forging
