[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][CloseEyes]Mother...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am so very sorry,[....] Princess Anthiese.[A]
But I would implore you to
spare your tears.[A]
Lady Liprica thought only of your health
and happiness until her final breath.[A]
Lady Liprica also left something
for you,[....] Your Highness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]For me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Aye,[....] milady.[.....] It is a circlet
that proves your royal standing.[A]
She asked that this be given to you
once you were of age.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A circlet...?
[MoveMidLeft]You can't mean the royal crown?![A]
Surely my mother had cause to hate
the monarchy above all else?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I fear I know not what her
intentions were,[....] milady.[A]
Nor have I the means of asking now.
But,[....] Your Highness...[A]
I know a time will come when your
mother's heart grows clear to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]The circlet is stored in the
vault at the Temple of Mila.[A]
I shall make my way there now.[A]
I must tell everyone that Her Highness
Anthiese has returned to us![A]
I will await your arrival at the temple.
May Mila's blessing be upon you always.[A]



[0A76]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][ToggleSmile]Ah, Celica!
I'm glad to see you safe, child.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]Nomah? What in the world
are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was worried about you.[A]
I followed you as far as this temple,
but this place is just so LARGE![A]
I'm embarrassed to say I got a bit
lost, little one. Heh heh heh![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, dear.[....] I'm glad those
priestesses were there to guide you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[....] I see we've some troublemakers
to clear out of the Mother's house.[A]
Might I fight alongside you from here on?[A]
Perhaps we'd both enjoy more peace
of mind if we stayed together.[A]
[OpenFarRight]We could really use your help
right now, Nomah.[....] Please do.[A]



[0A7A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x115]...There ain't no one here.[A]
Where's this Earth Mother
of yours hiding, lass?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]I don't understand...
[OpenEyes]Why isn't she here?[A]
[MoveLeft]She's supposed to be here![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B]Princess Anthiese![A]
[OpenLeft]Irma![....] Tell me what happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I beg forgiveness,[....] Your Highness.[A]
I had no idea the temple fell
to the empire while I was prisoner.[A]

They took Mila.[A]
It's unthinkable.[....] They're no knights--
only blasphemers and thieves![A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]The Rigelians hold Mila captive?!
You're certain of this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am,[....] Your Highness.
Emperor Rudolf led the charge himself.[A]
Sealed her powers and took her away.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]Rudolf himself...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Now, hold on just a tick.[A]
We get to the temple and
everything's taken care of.[A]
That was the deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]Unfortunately,[....] none of us expected
the Mother to have stepped out.[A]
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x112]Well,[....] I guess now we know why
the soil's gone barren.[A]
It's been cut off from Mila's bounty.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] What do we do now, milady?[A]
[OpenLeft][OpenEyes]The only thing we can.
We find the Mother and bring her back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh,[....] please take this as
kindly as possible, milady,[....] but...[A]
[MoveMidRight]Are you MAD?![....] How exactly do we
[OpenQuote]bring her back[CloseQuote]?[....] And from where?![A]
[OpenLeft]I don't know.[A]
But if the Rigelian Army took her,
she'll be somewhere in the empire.[A]
And since we've already
come to the border...[A]
Well,[....] we might as well
continue into Rigel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hold on just a moment.
You're saying we INVADE Rigel?[A]
[MoveMidRight]This isn't a motley band of
pirates or thieves--[A]
it's an entire empire of them![A]
We should all take a step back
and consider our opti--[A]
[OpenLeft]No amount of thinking will change
the situation.[....] Come, Boey.[A]
This isn't the first time we've
faced hopeless odds.[A]
And when people told us to give up,
did we run?[A]
We need to trust in our abilities.
We've come this far for a reason.[A]
And that reason is restoring Mila
to her rightful place.[A]
She's still the only one who can
save the world from this...[....] chaos.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight]...Nay,[....] she isn't.[A]
[OpenLeft]Hmm?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x16B]Sir Knight![....] You should be resting.
You mustn't strain your injuries.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I...[....] cannot miss this moment,[....] Sister
Irma.[....] With this, my mission ends.[A]
Whether I pass or live to see tomorrow's
light,[....] I will know I did what I could.[A]
[OpenLeft]What mission?[....] What is going on?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]Well?[....] Go on.
Please don't leave us in suspense.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight]Mila cannot save this world.
But you can[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] Princess Anthiese.[A]
[OpenLeft]Ah![....] How did you--[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]...This knight aided me on my
journey back to the temple.[....] He is--[A]
[OpenFarRight]--but a humble servant,[....] Your Highness.[A]
A servant who cannot rest until
the rightful heir is crowned.[A]
[MoveFarRight]I...[....] guh--[....] I bend the knee.
Please,[....] Sister Irma,[....] do the honors.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B]...Verily. I shall honor
Lady Liprica's dying wish.[A]
I bear the royal circlet
in my hands.[A]
Are you prepared to
accept it, Princess?[A]
[OpenLeft]How do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is no mere memento of your mother.[A]
It is a crown--[....]and accepting it
is a kind of coronation.[A]
As princess of Zofia,[....] are you prepared
to wear this and ascend the throne?[A]
[OpenLeft]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm afraid I know little of
kingdoms or the scope of rule.[A]
I thought my life would be better spent
serving my people as a priestess[A]
than being served as their princess.[A]
But I have people I wish to protect.
Both here and elsewhere.[A]
If I may use the power of the crown
to serve and protect,[....] I shall do so.[A]
I wish for this by my will alone.
For my own happiness.[A]
Is that resolve enough?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is indeed. [....][ToggleSmile]Princess Anthiese.[A]
By the authority the Mother has vested
in me,[....] this crown is now yours to bear.[A]
[OpenLeft]I accept it willingly.[A]



[0A7D]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x111][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x112][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenLeft]Hee hee.[....] Celica is just fine,[....] you two.[A]
Though,[....] from this day on,
I will no longer conceal my identity.[A]
I expect that will bring even more
hardship than we've faced till now.[A]
But I hope I can still
count on you all.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.....][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x129][MoveRight]A moment,[....] please,[....] Your Highness.
I bear a gift for you as well.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] a broken blade?[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x16B][MoveFarRight]That...![.....] Sir Knight,[....] that is
a fragment of the sword the Mother[A]
gave to her most beloved hero...
the queen for whom Zofia is named![A]
[OpenRight]It is of a rare and magical metal.[A]
No doubt the invaders sought it
for some nefarious purpose.[A]
I sustained these wounds intercepting
them as they fled the temple with it.[A]
[OpenFarRight]It would be of little use to
the Rigelians,[....] mercifully.[A]
Only the fire of Ragnarok,[A]
a spell which blesses only few
branches of Zofia's bloodline,[A]
can heat this blade.[A]
[OpenLeft]Ragnarok[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] [MoveLeft]Hold a moment.
I might just be able to make this work.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Truly?![....] Mila's greatest blessing...
I would be humbled to witness it.[A]
I will prepare the forge at once![A]
[ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Alas,[....] not enough metal remains
to forge a proper sword.[A]
But if we perhaps had a dagger
to serve as a base...[A]
[OpenLeft]I did once possess a suitable dagger,
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] it is no longer mine to give.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x115]Yeah, about that...[A]
[OpenLeft]Saber[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] That dagger was your rightly
earned payment.[.....] You needn't--[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]Ah,[....] hell with it![.....] Take it.
This ain't just business anymore.[A]
I've got a princess to swear fealty to.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]That crown suits you, lass.[A]
Or should I say [OpenQuote]Princess Anthiese.[CloseQuote][A]
Anyway,[....] our loyalty belongs to you,
for now and always.[A]
[OpenLeft]Thank you all. [....]Truly.[A]



[0A7E]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B]Please,[....] Princess Anthiese[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] You
must return Mila to her throne here.[A]
You have the power.[.....] I will stay and
ensure she has a home to return to.[A]
[OpenLeft]Do you know where she's been taken?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I fear they've taken her deep into
the Empire,[....] to Duma Tower in the north.[A]
The usurper-priest Jedah has made
his foul nest there.[A]
[OpenLeft]Then that's where we must go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x129]If you're headed into Rigel,[....] please
allow me to accompany you.[A]
[OpenLeft]But your injuries...
Irma insisted you must heal.[A]
The priestesses here will take much
better care of you than we could.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I vow I shall be no burden to you.
I know well the lands of this area.[A]
Allow me at least to guide you
to the Sage's Hamlet.[.....] A wise man[A]
called Halcyon resides there.[A]
I was in his care for many years,
and he will mostlike aid you as well.[A]
[OpenLeft]...I do owe you my thanks for
protecting my mother's friend.[A]
If this is the favor you ask,
then I shall grant it.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But you must promise me you will put
your full focus towards recovering.[A]
All right?[A]
[OpenFarRight]You have my word, Your Highness.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x113][ToggleSmile]Surprisingly enough,[....] I think I'm
starting to get used to him.[A]
[OpenLeft]He's not a bad sort--[....]and he clearly
cares about my well-being.[A]
I can't really ask for more
in such times.[.....] And yet,[A]
he's not without his mystery...[A]
I get a strange sense of nostalgia when
I'm near him,[....] though I've no clue why.[A]



[0ADF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][......]Those dragons,[....] rotting and mad...[A]
Could they once have been kin
to the likes of Duma and Mila?[A]
Is this the same fate that has befallen
Duma...[....] and that awaits Mila as well?[A]
Even in light of the inestimable
power of a divine dragon...[A]
when that power is given freely to
support generations upon generations[A]
of humans over countless centuries...[A]
Perhaps it isn't impossible that it
might take some kind of toll on them.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][....][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][....][CloseEyes]Mother Mila,[....] thou who hast given so
freely of thyself to shelter our kind[A]
from toil and thowel:[A]
forgive thy servant her blindness to
the cost of thy selfless sacrifices.[A]
[Clear]Mother Mila,[....] whose vengeance takes
upon those who profane thy soil[A]
with blood wrongly shed:
grant me wisdom that I might know[A]
mine own blood will not be shed
wrongly for thy sake.[A]
